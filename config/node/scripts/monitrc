    # Finally, Monit uses the system call execv to execute a program or a script. 
    # This means that you cannot write shell commands directly in the start, stop or exec statements. 
    # To do this, you must do as above; start a shell and issue your commands there. For example:
    # https://mmonit.com/wiki/Monit/FAQ#execution
    start program = "/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/systemctl start node'" with timeout 30 seconds
    stop program  = "/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/systemctl stop node'" with timeout 10 seconds
