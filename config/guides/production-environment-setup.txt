Set up
------

Blot depends on a file like environment.sh located at the path "/etc/blot/environment.sh". You must copy the template in this directory there and fill it out. The [upstart job](./upstart/blot.conf) for Blot depends on this.

Then make sure you make all the contents of scripts/production executable:

```shell
chmod +x scripts/production/start_blot.sh
```

AWS
---

At the moment I have moved Blot to an I3 instance which has 16GB of RAM, a 500GB SSD hardrive for temporary data.

The 500GB harddrive is what Amazon calls an 'instance store'. It should not be depended on. When the instance reboots the data on it is lost, I believe.

I think it might be a good idea to use it as a cache. I should also move my EBS data to a cheaper (non-ssd)drive. Then I can use the SSD drive that comes with the i3 instance.

The I3 instance offers volatile storage.

3/3/2018 I have since set up the instance store as a cache.

I followed these steps to set up the disk to use as a cache:

More instructions here:

I don't really care about write speed (as opposed to read speed) but here is a guide for optimizing write performance on instance stores:

Production machine configuration (Linux)
----------------------------------------

I made these changes to the AWS instance when I created it. I believe they were in the redis guide for getting good performance out of ec2 instances. But I'm not 100% sure...

sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1
sudo bash -c "echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled"
dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile1 bs=1024 count=4194304


Upstart
-------

Before we install our upstart scripts, we'll need to comment out ```Defaults    requiretty``` in /etc/sudoers. This allows me to run an upstart script as another user without a tty. Ideally, we'd use upstart's setuid feature, but the version of upstart that ships with amazon linux is too old and does not have that feature. To fix this, open /etc/sudoers and comment out requiretty by adding a '#' at the start of its line.

Upstart reads conf files in /etc/init. So run the script which will copy the file's from Blot's directory there, reload upstart's configuration, and then verify that upstart could load the scripts:

$ sudo ./scripts/production/update_upstart.sh

If the configuration is incorrect, the services will not appear on the output. Then you can start redis, then blot, then nginx.

```
> start redis
> start blot
> start nginx
```

If you'd like more information about the scripts, check the conf files. I've added plenty of comments. Remember that Blot needs redis to be running before it can run. This is documented in its conf file.


Monit
-----

Add a line to /etc/hosts file to allow monit to request localhost.
