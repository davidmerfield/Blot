1. Go to Blot's running instance and create a new amazon machine image (Actions > Image > Create image)
   This will be used to launch a new instance with the same disk?

2. Create new instance with larger disk.
  Set up nginx with letsencrypt
  verify it works with staging domain (blot.is?)
  Ensure it has keys and can transfer files from old instance with scp

3. Switch to maintenance state on old instance
nano config/flags.json
sudo stop blot && sudo start blot

4. Backup db on Blot
node scripts/backup.js

5. On the new instance sync blog folders:
rsync -avL --progress -e "ssh -i /var/www/blot/config/secrets/projects.pem" ec2-user@blot.im:/var/www/blot/blogs/* /var/www/blot/blogs

6.On the new instance, sudo copy acros redis dump:
sudo stop redis
scp -i /var/www/blot/config/secrets/projects.pem ec2-user@blot.im:/var/www/blot/db/dump.rdb /var/www/blot/db/dump.rdb
sudo start redis

7. Verify it is up to date

8. Switch elastic IP from old db to new DB
