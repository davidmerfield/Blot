First make sure that requests to blot.development go to localhost. You can't just use the hosts file since it doesn't support wildcard entries. I followed this guide so user subdomains work as expected:

It involved installing Dnsmasq using homebrew, then configuring it to resolve all requests to .development to localhost. Then I had to tell OSX's DNS resolver to pass requests to .development to Dnsmasq. Phew!
