To simulate failed renewals:

1. Create new Stripe test plan ```blot_10``` which costs $10 per day.
   Switch to using this guide in config/index.js  (config.stripe.plan)

2. Create new test users on this plan with the valid test card number ```4242 4242 4242 4242 ```
```
one@failed-subscription.com
two@failed-subscription.com
three@failed-subscription.com
four@failed-subscription.com
five@failed-subscription.com
six@failed-subscription.com
seven@failed-subscription.com
eight@failed-subscription.com
nine@failed-subscription.com
ten@failed-subscription.com
```
3. Switch all users to card number ```4000 0000 0000 0341``` which will fail in a day's time.

For good measure, I also created the account ```valid@subscription.com``` whose renewal should succeed.

Tomorrow, load test database after checking out this branch:

```
node scripts/folder/load.js failed-subscription
```

Then I updated the subscription for each user before logging in, since Stripe's webhooks won't have worked.

```
node scripts/user/updateSubscription.js one@failed-subscription.com
```

If needed, refer to the [version of the Stripe API Docs](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625062328/https://stripe.com/docs/api) which Blot uses.
