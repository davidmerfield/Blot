You need to generate a self-signed certificate and key pair then tell your system to trust it. I then load the key.pem and cert.pem files into the webserver.

Since Chrome 58, you need to declare a Subject Alternative Name. I don't really understand what that is or why it is neccessary but it is.

Here are the commands to generate the certificate and tell Keychain to trust the certificate (cert.pem):

openssl req \
    -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -x509 \
    -nodes \
    -keyout key.pem \
    -new \
    -out cert.pem \
    -subj /CN=blot.development \
    -reqexts SAN \
    -extensions SAN \
    -config <(cat /System/Library/OpenSSL/openssl.cnf \
        <(printf '[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:blot.development')) \
    -sha256 \
    -days 3650

sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain cert.pem

Then move these files to the location expected in dev-ssl.conf:

If needed, make the directory: sudo mkdir -p /etc/blot, then:

cp cert.pem /etc/blot/cert.pem
cp key.pem /etc/blot/key.pem

I then needed to create a symbolic link between:

ln -s /var/run/nginx.pid /usr/local/var/run/nginx.pid

To reload NGINX successfully
