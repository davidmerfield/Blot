# Enable retrying the next upstream on failure
# Important to limit the number of tries and possibly
# the timeout otherwise a single request which triggers an error could take down all the servers
# We do rolling deploys where one server is taken down at a time so this should allow 
# a failover in that case. Expensive or bug-triggering requests should consistently failwhale
# You have to be careful that these error codes are only returned when the server is truly
# unavailable – I ran into a nasty bug where a request that should have lead to a 404 was return
# a 500 error code, and this config considered the upstream server bad!
