# Mounting ephemeral storage on EC2

When you stop and then start an ec2 instance, its underlying hardware might change. This means the mounting you might have done for the ephemeral disk won't work. Here's the process for re-mounting this ephemeral disk.

to determine if the disk is mounted:

sudo lsblk

to mount the disk:

sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/nvme0n1
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1 /cache
sudo chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user /cache

restart blot:

sudo stop blot && sudo start blot
