# Update the version of Node

The most important step is to make sure you run Blot's test suite against the new version of node to catch any obvious breaking changes.

First, work out the version of node you'd like to use. I do this by visiting [the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and selecting the LTS (long term support) version recommended for most users.

The rest of the guide assumes this version happens to be ```18.15.0```.

## In development

First we need to make two changes to the codebase. Update the node version in .github/workflows/tests.yml:

```
  node-version: [18.15.0]
```

And edit ```BLOT_NODE_VERSION``` in ```config/environment.sh```. Commit and push to a new branch, wait for tests to run on continuous integration server.

To get the new version of node locally, install the version of node you'd like to use:

```
nvm install 18.15.0
```

Reinstall the node modules against the new version:

```
npm ci
```

Then edit ```/etc/blot/environment.sh``` and re-source those environment variables in any open sessions. Use the new version as the default for other projects too:

```
nvm alias default 18.15.0
```

## In production

```
edit BLOT_NODE_VERSION in /etc/blot/environment.sh
```

To get the new version of node locally, install the version of node you'd like to use:

```
nvm install 18.15.0
```

Reinstall the node modules against the new version:

```
npm ci
```

Restart the production server:

```
sudo stop blot && sudo start blot
```

Here's the production checklist for the PR:

```
- [ ] Edit BLOT_NODE_VERSION to 18.15.0 in `/etc/blot/environment.sh`
- [ ] nvm install 18.15.0
- [ ] npm ci
- [ ] sudo stop blot && sudo start blot
```

## In the past, I have needed to update other tools when increasing the node version.

The native module sharp required a few changes when upgrading from 12 to 16, specifically updating python:

and also updated gcc following this guide:

And I updated python
