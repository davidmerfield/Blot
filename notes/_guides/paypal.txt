So wanted to accept payments through PayPal.

signed up for a business account and verified my information. They wanted a scan of my ID and a copy of the first page of my last tax return. Then connected by bank account, the process was identical to setting up my personal account.

My goal is to accept subscription payments through PayPal. It was a little tricky to find but this is the getting started page for subscriptions, as opposed to payments:

https://developer.paypal.com/docs/subscriptions/integrate

Created a sandbox app and retrieved its credentials:

https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications

Then followed these instructions to generate an access token using the sandbox app:

https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/get-an-access-token-curl/

I also used the guide here to install the JavaScript SDK:

https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-node-SDK

Wrote a script to do this: 

node scripts/paypal/generate-access-token.js

Used these tokens to create a product:

node scripts/paypal/product/create.js

Verify the product was created by listing your products:

node scripts/paypal/product/list.js

Used this product tokens to create a plan:

node scripts/paypal/product/create.js

Verify the product was created by listing your products:

node scripts/paypal/product/list.js
