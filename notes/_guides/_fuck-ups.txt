# Fuck ups

- Don't use git to deploy code. One time I ran "git reset ==hard origin/master". Don't do this. It removed a load of files. Thankfully not dump.rdb, or config.json. But it did remove all my ssl certs.
- Forgot to create flags.json
- Forgot to move dhparams to config/secrets


I goofed by using elastic ips for inter-region communication – I should have used private IPs 

By using elastic IPs, I was charged data transfer ingress and egress fees, for my internal traffic, which was extremely expensive.
