How to stop and start an EC2 instance
=====================================

Somtimes an EC2 instance becomes unresponsive. The instance doesn't respond to requests over HTTP, ssh connections or even system reboots. This is a problem since we can't  want to get the server responsive again when it's down.

What's the solution?
-------------------
Instead of a system level reboot â€“ I manually stop and then manually start the instance. 

How to automate this?
-------------------
Cloudwatch offers an action to reboot an instance when an alarm is going. However, it does not seem to offer a way to stop-then-start an instance when an alarm is going.

So, I ended up delivering a message to SNS when a cloudwatch alarm is going off. I then subscribe to this message queue from a lambda function which itself stops an instance, then starts it again.

CloudWatch (ec2 instance monitoring) -> SNS (simple notification service) -> Lambda (serverless function invocation)

Improvements
-------------------
- Increase granularity of Cloudwatch checks but add ways to prevent an infinite loop
- if the server responds 200 OK to the web request then exit the script
- wait for the server to respond 200 OK before exiting lambda script?
- don't run the function more than once in paralell
- wait for at least x minutes before re-running the function?
