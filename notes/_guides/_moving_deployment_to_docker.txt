issue to resolve: how to flush the reverse proxy cache? localhost (127.0.0.1 is now different)

work out how to get to bind the server for /purge in openresty conf listening on private IP of ec2 instance

then reload openresty conf and 

BIG CHANGE: begin making updates to openresty config

now with the changes to openresty config, I have the node container communicating with the cache purge

----

done:
 update node app container to accept env variable which includes a comma seperated list of reverse proxy IPs so it can purge the cache properly
 get health check working on container


---


todo:
 run the setup script, the folder build script, and more on the container
   - how much of this can be done ahead of time?
 check that the notes directory, .git folder, exist so the about and news pages render
 disable monit before we shut down the server listening on 8080
 work out how we are going to handle logs? they will be stored in docker
   - will not logging to previous file break anything? stat gathering?
 work out how we will run scripts – we'll need to ssh into blot and then into the docker container?
