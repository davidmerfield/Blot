18. make menu a model?
    ensure concurrent changes to user's menu works
    also background changes succeed if user presses submit
    on settings page (with no local changes)

    background:
    cannot affect order
    or links existence
      rem
      push

    foreground:
    cannot affect pages existence
    can affect links and order
      rem
      insert
      reorder

    for each page verify it still exists
      if not trim it from updates
