# Strategy to sync a folder to remote server

Syncs appear as create or drops

Given an array of changes.
	
filter changes and make them relative to a blog's folder
-> move add them to individual blogs queue
-> filter renames
-> sort changes and put drops before creates & renames?

push timestamped list of changes to redis queue per blog

Save new folder state instantly.

call queue.process (blogID)

pop change from front of queue set, to active set, if fails, return it to front of queue.

-> on server restart, return all active to queue, then call queues

for drops, do the drop

for creates, make a dropbox client and get the file to save it

Immediately process drops. 

Once all is done, run a validation of the folder? Probably not. Maybe do this once an hour, or once a day? Would need to wait for queue to empty for this to work.

# Validate

build local tree of folder, in memory? fine.
build remote tree of folder -> client.delta('')

compare trees, drop any ghost local entries
