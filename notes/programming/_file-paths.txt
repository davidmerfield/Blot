# File paths

we really have three paths for a file on blot.

1. the 'blot path'
  -> relative to blog folder
2. the 'dropbox path'
  -> blogfolder + 'blot path'
3. the 'local path'
  -> blog dir + 'blot path'

how do we track these?
I should *not* modifiy the dropbox file object to keep things simple.
