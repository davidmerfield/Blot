# Routing

URL routes to blog

sidenote -> expose req.query as {{query}} in templates?
	could be useful… how could we pass this into templates?{{recentEntries:query.from query.to}}? mental…

Entry URLs should have:
- leading slashes
- no trailing slashes

3. check if ‘/assets/*’
	-> assets route

3. check if ‘/plugins/*’
	-> plugins route

4. check if ‘/draft/*’
	-> draft route

3. check if ‘/tagged/*’
	-> tag route

2. check if ‘/search’
	-> search route

2. check if ‘/robots.txt’
	-> robots route for preview URLs

3. check if ‘/verify/domain-setup’
	-> verify route

1. check if ‘/‘
	-> entries route

2. fall through to ‘/*’

	if view matches route exactly
		-> render view

	if entry url matches route exactly
		-> render entry

	extract entry ID from URL (first term before slash)
	and if entryID matches entry:
		-> render entry
