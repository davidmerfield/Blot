# Strategies for zero downtime deployment

There's a daemon which runs all the time, kept alive with upstart

Monit will call a script to 'reboot'

  server will listen for kill event

    server will send appropriate responses to dropbox webhooks

    then call server.close

    then it will try to start new server

    then the second process calls close

    then it starts again with new code

Reboot will try to close an existing process if it can then
