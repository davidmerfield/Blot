# Development environment

## A simple guide to setting up a running Blot server on your own machine. 

## Requirements
- git
- a few gigabytes of disk space
- a gigabyte of memory

## 1. Install `nvm` and use it to set up `node` v12.16.3 and `npm` 6.14.4.

## 2. Install `redis` and run `redis-server`

## 2. Clone Blot's source code to your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot
```

## 3. Install Blot's dependencies:
```
npm ci
```

## 4. Run Blot's local server:
```
npm run local
```

You should then see your blog here:
```
http://localhost:8081
```
and the dashboard to configure the settings for that blog here:
```
http://localhost:8080
