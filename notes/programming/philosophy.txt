# Philosophy

## What I have learnt programming Blot

The most important goal is reliability, then speed.

## Infrastructure
- **A limited palette of boring technology** I'd avoid using tools that have been around for less than a decade in anything you plan to depend upon.
- **Understand the environment in which your code runs** 

## Back-end
- **Speed above everything**

- **Avoid microservices** Perhaps there is way to make these work but I haven't achieved it yet.

- **Keep track of your bottlenecks** Blot involves lots of i/o, like reading files from a disk or syncing a file over a network. Because of this, most of what really needs to be optimized is i/o. Nothing is especially computationally intensive. Shaving even one external HTTP request from a function will save infinitely more than endless language-level performance optimization.

## Front-end

- **Speed above everything**. I run almost everything send to the client through as many minifiers and compressors as is reasonable. I want to improve the speed of Blot. I also use a neat script called [instant.page](https://instant.page/) to begin fetching a page when the user hovers over a link.

- **As little JavaScript as possible**. In general, I want to do as much computation as possible on the server, as little as possible on the client. This is because I control the server, but not the client.
