I will need a script to write out existing templates in new format


# Revisiting templates

blogs/{{id}}/themes/{{default}}

set blog.template to {{default}} ?

create new Template "Foo bar" in blogs/{{id}}/themes/Foo bar

editing will just save the files directly

can rename the template -> copy folder, set blog.template to new folder, delete old folder.

we could load a users template into memory instead? but what about static files? eh avoid this optimization for now.

we only need to serve-static the non-css and js files in /assets?

on enable local-editing

 theme / theme.json etc...

on enable local editing for multiple

 theme / foo
 theme / bar





Templates should be copy/pastable between blogs

Installation of custom template should be as easy as

'Create folder Template:

Blot themes are derived from a folder of HTML fragments.

If you want to just a tweak a thing or two with an existing template, it's not really neccessary to read all the nonsense below. Just create a clone of the template you'd like to modify, then open it in the template editor. It should be self-explanatory.

Blot uses Mustache to render templates. Please read its documentation. It is important you understand the meaning of a template, a partial and a view.

Blot themes are a collection of **templates** and **partials** which are rendered with a **view** containing variables from your blog.

**Templates** represent the layout for a given page on your blog. **Partials** represent small fragments of a template that repeat across your site like a menu. The **view** is a collection of variables, structured as JSON, which is used to render your template.

Blot generates the view for a template based on a few inputs:

- The tags used in the template
- Local variables specified in your theme's configuation file
- Properties from your blog (e.g. title, profile picture)
- Variables derived from the template's route

## Configuration file

You can use the configuration file to declare template-specific locals and partial templates. Blot's themes use this feature to customize the <title> and description tags of each template.

## Templates

Blot themes inherit a handful of templates and options by default:

- feed.rss (for your blog's RSS feed)
- robots.txt
- sitemap.xml

I assume you probably won't want to modify them, but you can override these templates yourself by creating the corresponding file in your theme's /templates directory.

The template site.xml would be rendered at the url example.com/site.xml. The template foo.html would be rendered at the url example.com/foo. You can adjust the url for a given template. The exceptions are entries.html, entry.html and error.html. Error.html is used for all routes which return nothing. You can override this in your theme's configuration file.

## Partials

If a partial file is called 'footer.html', blot will make it available to views like this:

```
{{> footer}}
```

## Routing

With the exception of entry.html and entries.html, you control the routes
If a view file is called 'archives.html', by default Blot will mount it to /archives You can customize the route used for the view in theme.json.

## Assets

Files in the /assets folder are served. JavaScript and CSS files are minified and rendered like templates. This means you can use variables from your blog or your template inside scripts and stylesheets:

```
body {
  background: {{background_color}};
}
```

Everything else is served as-is. This folder is useful for template-specific images, font-files and that kinds of thing.




stick files inside? indicate selected template with leading *? How does blot know which template to use? Do user templates always exist in Blog folder?

move _assets to .assets or .blot ?
  image cache cannot look up images embedded in doc files
  since they're outside the blot folder

put templates inside this folder

Rewrite Templates
 - Add way to edit a color variable, select an option etc...
 - theme should be a set of options for the color picker...
 - Migrate these currently-global settings to template level:
    date presentation
    hide/show date
    entries per page
 - Store view name should include file extension...
 - Expose errors in modules/template/update on design page.







I need to make sure Blot can render 100 pages / second.

Based on current usage, that reflects double the avg. load for 10k blogs.

the render module is currently a shitshow

each template

ENTRIES SHOULD NOT BE VIEWS
  they should not be embeddable -> use albums for similar features...

LOCALS SHOULD NOT CONTAIN LOCALS
  migrate page title and page description to hard coding in template

EACH VIEW SHOULD HAVE A FULL LIST OF PARTIALS & LOCALS


add 'default' template views which templates inherit but can override?

add 'default' partials which templates inherit?

  e.g. {{view.name}} - {{blog.title}}

e.g. feed.rss, sitemap.xml, robots.txt


* / template / default

no template info stored in db

everything stored on disk?

---


template = read(...) ;

mustache.parse(template);

... fetch partials and parse them too
... extract locals from view and all partials
... load locals

mustache.render(template, view);

---

store full list of locals and paths to partials against each template path?
