# Technique

## The tools and methods we use to write Blot's source code

## Web server
- [nginx]() handles all inbound traffic and then passes of anything it can't handle to our application server. 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) runs out application server is written in JavaScript and run with . I made this decision because I was vaguely familiar with JavaScript when I first started working on Blot. [express]() is the framework we use.

## Version control

- [git](https://git-scm.com/) was our first choice and so it remains. 

## Database

- [Redis](https://redis.io/) for almost all data that needs to persist that isn't efficient to store on disk. We plan to move some of this data into postgres eventually.
- [PostgreSQL]() stores all the [questions](/questions) and will eventually store more of the user data currently in redis.

## SSL certificates
- [Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is our certificate authority.
- [lua-resty-auto-ssl](https://github.com/auto-ssl/lua-resty-auto-ssl) is responsible for requesting certificates from Let's encrypt then storing them in redis.

## Testing
- [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) runs our test suite.
- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) is the framework we used to create our test suit.
- [seedrandom]() and [faker]() are combined to produce reproducible randomized unit tests.

## Excellent JavaScript libraries

- [sharp]()
- [cheerio]()
- [mustache]()
- [katex]()
- [moment]()
- [async]() I'm slowly moving away but it was invaluable in the early days.

## Production environment

- [AWS linux]() is where Blot's software runs.

## Development environment

- [macOS]() is the operating system on which I write Blot's source code.
- [Sublime text]() is the text editor in which I write the code. I still aspire to learn how to use vim.
- [localhost.run](https://localhost.run/) sends webhooks to our development environment for testing integration with external APIs like Dropbox or Google Drive. It's an excellent service.
- [iTerm]() is where I run the code.
- [JSHint]() and [Prettier]() lint the code I write.
- All of this runs on a 12-inch [MacBook]() with an Intel 1.2 GHz m3 processor and 8 GB of RAM. I use a laptop stand atop a stack of books, along with an external keyboard and mouse, for posture. I do not have an external monitor since it is important to be able to put my desk into a state with no visible technology.
