Open source
===========

Blot caters to a largely technical audience, and I'm asking that audience to invest a good deal of their time and some of their money in a piece of software. A large fraction of that audience is sceptical of closed-source, proprietary software. So it makes business sense for me to make [Blot's source code](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot) available freely under the most permissive license possible. I also quite like the spectacle of working in public. I suspect it's reassuring to potential customers to see my frantic [git commits on the news page](https://blot.im/news), for them to know that Blot is very much _alive_.

Open-source vs. free software
-----------------------------

On a more abstract level, I like the ideals of the free software movement. I like Richard Stallman, for what it's worth. I think the 'free software' term is confusing, especially since I charge money to host Blot, and although I'm aware of the politics of the term 'open source', so I decide to side-step both terms and simply say _Blot's source code is dedicated to the public domain_.
