# Censorship

Blot has been running for a while now and there is plenty published on it that I dislike. I have the means to remove this material but I won't, partly because of my laziness but mostly because I think any system of censorship would cause more harm that the material that is censored. 

This is one reason why I avoided depending on advertisers to fund Blot. The large businesses that tend to buy advertising are risky patrons. They always impose a regime of censorship in their own bland interests which tend to push down on all that is against the grain. I'm motivated to provide a platform for the radical and avant-garde even if it means tolerating stuff that upsets *the market*.

## So you accept that free speech causes harm?

Yes, I think that being serious about the principle of free speech means accepting that real harm can result. My belief is that the harm resulting from censorship is greater than the harm resulting from free speech.

## Blot's a private organization, why care about free speech?

Because I think the principle of free speech is a good principle. The framers of the American constitution liked the principle of free speech enough to write the first amendment. Even though the first amendment doesn't apply to Blot, I can still appreciate the principle of free speech.

## Will you allow extremists to host websites on Blot? 

The answer is yes, as long as they follow the law. For as long as it is legal in the United States to be extreme and to express oneself *extremely*, it will be possible to do so on Blot.

## What if a foreign government threatens to block you?

At some point in future, I suspect Blot will be blocked in one country or another. Perhaps some government official will ask me to block or remove some content from the site. Plenty of tech companies with idealistic mission statements are unable to resist this – I think it's understandable, when you have employees whose livelihoods depend on continued growth in those markets. But I don't plan on ever making money in the sorts of places in which this is likely to happen, so it won't matter much to me if they choose to seal themselves off from Blot.

## What if I still disagree with you?

I do think that reasonable people can disagree about the principle of free speech. We've been arguing this principle for thousands of years and the debate will go on. Blot's [source-code](/notes/politics/open-source) is dedicated to the public domain. You can host it on your own server if you like.
