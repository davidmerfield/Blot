# Open source

## A partly moral and partly cynical decision to make Blot's source code public

Open source feels good. It suggests a modest attitude to money that seems dignified. Although these aesthetic considerations are most important, open source is also appealing to a technical audience, who are often sceptical of proprietary closed-source software. So it makes business sense for me to make [Blot's source code](/about/source-code) available freely under the most permissive license possible. 

## As a moral decision

Intellectual property as a legal regime has its costs and its benefits. Ideas are obviously innately free but sometimes there are advantages to setting up legal structures to protect them. But generally I think the legal structures we've established to protect intellectual property are overgrown and tend to limit rather than encourage creation, so I will not participate.

## Working in public

I also quite like the spectacle of working in public. I suspect it's reassuring to potential customers to see my  [git commits on the news page](https://blot.im/news), for them to know that Blot is  _alive_.

## Terminology

I like the ideals of the free software movement and I like Richard Stallman. However, I think the *free* part of Stallman's term *free software* is confusing. After starting too many explanations with *it's not free as in beer...* I've not to push against the current of popular usage. I'm also aware of the politics of the term 'open source', so I decide to side-step both and simply say _Blot's source code is dedicated to the public domain_.
