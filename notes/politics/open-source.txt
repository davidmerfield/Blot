Open source
===========

Blot caters to a largely technical audience, and I'm asking that audience to invest a good deal of their time and some of their money in a piece of software. A large fraction of that audience is sceptical of closed-source, proprietary software. So it makes business sense for me to make [Blot's source code](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot) available freely under the most permissive license possible. I also quite like the spectacle of working in public. I suspect it's reassuring to potential customers to see my frantic [git commits on the news page](https://blot.im/news), for them to know that Blot is very much _alive_.

Open source? Free software?
-----------------------------

I like the ideals of the free software movement and I like Richard Stallman. However, I think the *free* part of Stallman's term *free software* is confusing. After starting too many explanations with *it's not free as in beer...* I've not to push against the current of popular usage. I'm also aware of the politics of the term 'open source', so I decide to side-step both and simply say _Blot's source code is dedicated to the public domain_.
