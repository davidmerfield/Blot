[Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) - Stole much of the copy from their terms page and privacy policy. Macej's design 'philosophy' was also influential. If I could only steal his sense of humour.

[Kirby](http://getkirby.com) - Stole some of their marketing copy. Looking back, they're likely the subliminal inspiration for Blot's logo.

[New York Times](http://nytimes.com) - Their type treatment of Georgia was ripped and used to design the default theme.

[Cargo Collective](https://cargocollective.com/) - I think they do some really interesting, thoughtful work. Stolen from their selection of themes to help make Blot's.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - A spiritual ancestor to Blot. A beautiful piece of software.

[Stripe](http://stripe.com) - Stole from their excellent support & documentation section when writing Blot's documentation.

[Subtraction](http://subtraction.com) - The original Blot template was massively influenced by Khoi Vinh's blog.

[Second Crack](http://www.marco.org/secondcrack) The project which runs Marco Ament's blog, shares a lot of the design principles of Blot. I didn't see this until after opening Blot to the public and I wish I'd seen it sooner.
