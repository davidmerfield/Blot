## How to create an effective brochure and documentation for a SAAS product

## Copy

I tried to avoid using adjectives in any of the copy.

## Social proof

Instead of a wall of logos of corporations that use Blot, I went with a wall of people who use Blot.

## Sign up page

Designing the sign up page for Blot.

The goal of the sign-up form is to get new customers onto Blot. 


Why doesn't Blot have pricing tiers?
------------------------------------

In general, I feel like there's an overwhelming amount of choice in the world. Some of this choice is good and warranted but I feel annoyed when I have to dig through a variety of offerings that have been clearly. I recognize this means I'm giving up revenue.

Also, I don't like the look of those tables, with three or four choices, a feature list to compare against. Blot has one option, one price, one fewer decision to make.



Why not use a price ending in .99?
----------------------------------

Why is the price $5 rather than $4.99 a month? I don't like the look of prices that end in .99. It always struck me as a cheap trick. The number is messier too. Why use five glyphs if we can get away with two? I know it works, but I know that it's working on me.
