# Aesthetic

## On the visual appearance of Blot's software

In lots of ways, Blot is hidden. Most of the time, people who use Blot do so without looking at it. They simply edit the folder

## Text

Blot uses [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/)'s terrific *Inter* font on its brochure website and dashboard. One day I would like to fully realize my aesthetic preferences and use a font I have designed from scratch.


## Black or white backgrounds

Almost every website has a white or light background. So, Blot has a light background. It feels familiar. However, I do sometimes wonder about inverting the color scheme.

I like how [David Rudnick](https://davidrudnick.org/) justified the black backgrounds of his work. To paraphrase – the way computer screens work is they emit light, and that digital artifacts are light, in lots of ways.

I also spend most of my day in a text editor with a dark background, and find it comfortable on the eyes.

All of Blot's themes can be toggled to from white to black with a single click on the template editor. Perhaps one day I will switch everything from white by default to black by default.

## Emojis

I dislike emojis. Partly because they are infantile. I also dislike them because they are corporate. To use an emoji is to surrender control over your speech to a megacorporation. See the [pistol emoji](https://emojipedia.org/pistol/) for reference: on some platforms it appears as a gun, on others a water pistol.
