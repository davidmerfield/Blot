## On the visual appearance of Blot's software

In lots of ways, Blot is hidden. Most of the time, people who use Blot do so without looking at it. They simply edit the folder.

## My tastes 

I find old books, especially Italian ones of the 16th century, to be very beautiful. I like objects that can age and break and be repaired with dignity. I like medieval buildings and I don't think that ornament is always a crime. I like things which can be handed down, things that have been handed down.

## Text

Blot uses [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) by Rasmus Andersson on its brochure website and dashboard. 



## Emojis

I dislike emojis mostly because they seem to be designed for children. I also dislike them because to use them means to let a corporation control your . To use an emoji is to surrender control over your speech to a megacorporation. See the [pistol emoji](https://emojipedia.org/pistol/) for reference: on some platforms it appears as a gun, on others a water pistol.




## Black or white backgrounds

Almost every website has a white or light background. So, Blot has a light background. It feels familiar. However, I do sometimes wonder about inverting the color scheme.

I like how [David Rudnick](https://davidrudnick.org/) justified the black backgrounds of his work. To paraphrase â€“ the way computer screens work is they emit light, and that digital artifacts are light, in lots of ways.

I also spend most of my day in a text editor with a dark background, and find it comfortable on the eyes.

All of Blot's themes can be toggled to from white to black with a single click on the template editor. Perhaps one day I will switch everything from white by default to black by default.
