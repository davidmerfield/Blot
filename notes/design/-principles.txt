# Principles

## On the aesthetic and design philosophy which lead to Blot

In lots of ways, Blot is hidden. Most of the time, people who use Blot do so without looking at it. They simply edit the folder. Some things however, are visible. The templates, which I am not yet proud of, are an example of this.

The *aesthetic* is one of my main motivations to work on Blot. I find a lot of the internet deeply ugly. My interests in type design lead me to study the work of the early printers, and I find their books to be intensely beautiful. It upsets me that though we are decades into the internet, it remains generally ugly.

I find old books, especially Italian ones made by early printers, to be very beautiful. I like objects that can age and break and be repaired with dignity. I like medieval buildings and I don't think that ornament is always a crime. I like things which can be handed down, things that have been handed down. Old books taught me that beauty is a prophylactic for destruction.

## Typefaces I like

- [**Inter**](https://rsms.me/inter/) by Rasmus Andersson is used by us on the brochure website and dashboard. 
- [**Charter**]() which I like used on [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/multimodal-neurons/)'s blog posts.


## Things I dislike

- **Emojis**: &puncsp; I dislike emojis partly because they look childish but mostly because their design is controlled by a corporation. See the [pistol emoji](https://emojipedia.org/pistol/) for reference: on some platforms it appears as a gun, on others a water pistol. I love text.

- **SAAS aesthetic**: &puncsp; Three-column pricing pages, enquire for enterprise rates, live-chat popups: 'How can we help?', a team page filled with grinning teeth in matching swag at the biannual beach retreat.

## Sites I like

If you look closely, you can probably feel the influence of these sites on Blot:

- [**Pinboard**](https://pinboard.in/) of all the projects in the world, Pinboard exerts the greatest influence on Blot
- [**Cargo**](https://cargocollective.com/) they do make the internet more beautiful
- [**Are.na**](https://www.are.na/)
- [**Urbit**](https://urbit.org/) I like how they used Input. I also like the way they communicate their project.
- [**Matthew Butterick**](https://mbtype.com/bio.html)
- [SB-PH](https://sb-ph.com/)
- [Jake Dow-Smith](https://jakedowsmith.studio/)
- [**gov.uk**](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
- [**Mirror**](https://mirror.xyz/) I like [Jon-Kyle
](https://www.jon-kyle.com/)'s work (also involved with Cargo) and I like [Seth Thompson](https://seththompson.org/)'s work.
- [**Overcase**](https://overcast.fm/)

## Calming

A lot of software makes me less calm. I want Blot to make more more calm, or at least not less calm.

## Black or white backgrounds

Almost every website has a white or light background. So, Blot has a light background. It feels familiar. However, I do sometimes wonder about inverting the color scheme.

I like how [David Rudnick](https://davidrudnick.org/) justified the black backgrounds of his work. To paraphrase – the way computer screens work is they emit light, and that digital artifacts are light, in lots of ways.

I also spend most of my day in a text editor with a dark background, and find it comfortable on the eyes.

All of Blot's themes can be toggled to from white to black with a single click on the template editor. Perhaps one day I will switch everything from white by default to black by default.
