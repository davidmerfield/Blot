Hi, welcome to Blot!
A blogging platform for lazy people

Hi. This is Blot. A blogging platform.

Check the blog for the latest.

Made in the USA

It’s the best blogging platform. Publish a post from your phone. Fix a web page from the back of a car. It’s elegant, powerful, and always ready.

Start from scratch or choose from a variety of included templates.


Any Content You Like

Blog articles, galleries, simple pages or complex product sheets – with Kirby you are not limited to a fixed data structure. You are in control of


Why isn’t there a free plan?
We want Cushion to live a long and healthy life, and we want to afford to work on it. That’s only possible if it can pay for itself.

# Bring your own morals

I am unconcerned with the moral quality of what you publish.  I don't have to energy to evaluate all the erotic poetry published on Blot, let alone the scatological short stories. If it's legal, it stays.

## Should I switch to Blot from another platform?

It's probably more effort than it's worth. Some of Blot's user have written some export tools for Tumblr, Wordpress and Jekyll.

## Should I use Blot or Medium?

Just use Medium. By the way, if anyone comes across anything worthwhile on that platform, please contact me. They've published 2 million articles and each one apparently frivolous.

## Will Blot make me write more?

No. Blot might make publishing a blog easier but it's not going to turn you into Cicero.

## Where does the subscription fee go?

My bank account.

## Don't suffer for your success

Most of the blogs on Blot receive around 100,000 visitors or fewer a month. The annual fee of $20 ensures that Blot is profitable. Large bursts of traffic aren't a big deal, but if you're planning to host a large publication on Blot, perhaps consider hosting yourself because...

## Blot is run by one person

That's me. If I get hit by a bus: all your blog posts are on your machine and the source code is public. I'm sure you'll manage. At this point, I just tend to the few bugs left and ensure things run smoothly.

## A hosted service

I have to wake up at 3am to fix something instead of you. If the service goes down at 3am you'll have to wake me up.


## Feature requests

I built Blot to be the blogging platform I want. I recognize it is a niche product and I'm not going to do anything retarded and raise funding or employ people. I've been on that proverbial rollercoaster before and it was silly.

This means that I only add features to the platform which I want to exist. Otherwise I won't care to implement them properly.

## Branding

As far as I'm concerned, advertising is the devil and anyone party to it should be lined up at shouted at until they past. One of my goals has been to ensure that it would difficult to tell whether or not a blog is published on Blot. Even the source code.


## The worst are full of passionate intensity

I don't *really* care about this. It's a way to host my writing which got a little out of hand. 100% passion-free guarantee. If you want passion, go public your listicle on Medium.

Tumblr is so easy to use that it’s hard to explain.
We made it really, really simple for people to make a blog and put whatever they want on it. Stories, photos, GIFs, TV shows, links, quips, dumb jokes, smart jokes, Spotify tracks, mp3s, videos, fashion, art, deep stuff. Tumblr is 236 million different blogs, filled with literally whatever.

You do this:

1. Write a blog post, take a photo. THis is the hard part.
2. Drag and drop the post or image into Blot's folder

Blot does the rest automatically:

1. Downloads the file from Dropbox
2. Converts it into a blog post. If there's text, it will typeset it.
3. Publish it to your blog, add it to your RSS feed & search engine.



Blot is friendly to designers and developers.

straightforward. Customzing an existing template
is easy too.

Unbranded – blot's logo appears nowhere on your blog.
Blot comes with plugins to make writing even easier:

Make a simple app which interacts with the Blot folder somehow to demonstrate that its easy to make tools for publishing with Blot.

Hello there, I've just created an account and Blot has added a folder to my Dropbox. This is that folder. Blot looks for files inside this folder and turns them into blog posts.

Here's a text file containing my first blog post on my desktop. To publish it to my blog, all I have to do is put it in Blot’s folder.

*move file*

Once Dropbox has synced the file, Blot will publish it to my blog. And there it is!

If I want to edit the blog post, all I have to do is edit the file. Blot will update the post automatically.

Blot can also publish images and it works the same way.

*move file*

Lots of people use Blot for scrapbooking – it’s very simple to use!

Here’s a file which has more complicated formatting. It’s got Math equations set in LaTex, some code snippets, embedded images and videos. Blot can understand all this, so when I publish it to my blog it will display correctly. There we go!

Blot also supports HTML with javascript and CSS so you can have total control over your blog posts. Here’s a file which makes use of that.

*move file*

Blot will generate an archives page, RSS feed, sitemap, and a search engine for each blog automatically. It’s got all the features you could want from a blogging platform.

Blot also makes it easy to preview a post before publishing it to my blog. All I have to do is add draft to the file’s name and Blot will create a preview for me. Here it is.

*open file*

This is exactly how it will appear on my blog. When I’m happy, all I have to do is remove ‘draft’ from the file’s name and Blot will publish it. There it is, live on my blog!
