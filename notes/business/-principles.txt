# Principles

## The theory and assumptions which guide how we do business

I will sell the service to the people who want to host their blog on Blot. I will not generate income in any other way. The amount the customer pays for the service will be higher than the average amount I spend to provide the service, returning a profit with pays for the labor of the people who work on Blot. 

## Charge money

I have no interest in providing a service for free and then monetising the people who use our service. That business model although obviously successful seemed dishonest to me. Instead we offer a straightforward proposition: we provide hosting and support for your blog, you pay us a modest fee.

## Leave money on the table

Blot is not optimized to generate maximally revenue in the short-term. I try to take a long-term view where I can. For example, I do lots of things which might hurt my short-term customer churn rate. I'm serious about making Blot a long-term business and view these sacrifices as investments.

## Allow customers to leave with ease

A number of subscription businesses put up barries when customers want to cancel their subscription. I make it easy to quit Blot. This is not because I am a good person, although I am, it is because someone who quits Blot is still a person who knows about Blot. Someone who leaves Blot with a good taste in their mouth might recommend it to others, or even come back and use Blot again. Pissing them off when they leave prevents this.

## Choose people rather than businesses as customers

I have chosen to aim the product toward consumers, rather than business customers, to reduce the stress involved in running the project. I've also watched a number of services gradually drift in focus over the years as they realize that all the money is in selling to businesses.

## Treat our customers equally

There's something about tiered services which leaves a bad taste in my mouth. On Blot, everyone pays the same and everyone receives the same service.

## Avoid investment and stay profitable

I do not plan to raise investment in Blot. The main concern I'd have with bringing in investors would be the risk of compromising the aesthetic. It's vitally important that I love Blot and I know from experience that when one raises money one is forced into decisions that will make me love Blot less. Since I opened Blot to the public, it has been profitable and it remains profitable. I'm sure it makes business sense to raise money but I like how things are going.

## Set the price at what we'd pay

I set the price of Blot at whatever I would be comfortable paying myself. When I started Blot, it cost $1 a month. I've improved Blot since then and now a site costs $5 a month. I feel that's still a fair price since I provide web hosting and personal support. 

I know I could get away with charging more. I know this because I get regular emails from customers telling me this. However, I'm interested in having Blot in the hands of more people, even if it means generating less revenue.
