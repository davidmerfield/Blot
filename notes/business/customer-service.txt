# Customer service

## How we help solve our customers' problems

Before working on Blot, I hadn't had a customer-facing job. Here are a few of things I have learned over the years. It's worth mentioning that Blot's customers have been polite and good-natured, even in situations when a lapse in politeness would have been reasonable.

## Tracking requests

We use a [text-file](/about/notes/business/technique) to track all of the tasks for Blot. If the task involves following up with the customer – perhaps fixing a bug or adding a feature – we add a link to the relevant email correspondence.

Because this text-file is also used to render our [News](/news) page, the customer has a public committment from us that we will fix their problem. This helps, especially when the problem takes a while to solve.


## Responding to suggestions

Plenty of the suggestions we receive from our customers are good and are eventually incorporated into the software. However, when the suggestion isn't suitable, it's important to learn how to say no politely and concisely. This became easier with practice.

## Bad habits

- **Asking the customer to provide information that is easy to look up**

  I often find myself asking the customer information that I could look up with a little effort (*what's the URL to your site? which blog post are you having that issue with?*). Responding with even a single question back makes it much more likely the customer will lose interest in the issue, which sometimes feels like solving the problem, but really isn't.

- **Taking too long to respond**

  When the customer's inquiry involves a bug whose solution is easy, I found myself waiting to fix the bug before responding to the customer. The proper way to handle things is first to respond saying I am fixing the problem, then follow up with a response when the problem is fixed, rather than leave the customer in the dark until the problem is fixed.

- **Avoiding responsibility for mistakes**

  When a bad bug in our product affects a customer, I found it easy to use language which seperated myself from the bug. I find it annoying when people fail in their job and don't take responsibility for it. I don't want to do that myself, although it is tempting.

- **Mistyping the customer's name**
  
  I have made too many errors transcribing a customer's name from memory. I now copy and paste the name to avoid these mistakes.

- **Constantly checking my support inbox**

  I often find myself aimlessly refreshing the inbox for supoprt requests when I should be working. I also find myself distracted by a new support 

## Always leave the door open

I try and end all of my communication with customers with something along the lines of *Can I help you with anything else?*. I know it's cheesy but I worry that without it, an excessively polite customer might worry that I'm somehow annoyed that they've emailed me to ask something they could have found out with one or two web searches.
