# Mistakes  

Some of the decisions I've changed my mind on as I've run Blot

## Charging annually rather than monthly

For the first few years of business, Blot asked its customers to pay once a year. This has the following benefits:
- lower transaction fees
- money up front

Charging monthly reduces the commitment involved, and although it's hard to know if this is mere correlation, the number of customers increased when I made the switch. It makes sense to me that more people are willing to take the plunge when the initial commitment required is 30 days. I also got far fewer requests for refunds – I always issue refunds when asked but it takes time to do this, and increases the cost of support.
