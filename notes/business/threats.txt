# Threats

There are a number of things that could go wrong. Below are a list of threats to Blot's business that go beyond being merely made irrelevant by a better competitor.

## Payment processing issues

We use Stripe to process 100% of our payments. If Stripe closed our account we would be without revenue. 

*Solutions*: 
- Spread payments across different payment processors. We could run a percentage of our payments through Braintree. 
- Support other payment methods: PayPal.
- Support payment methods without an intermediary: cryptocurrency is the best option.

## Hosting provider issues

We use AWS to host the site. If AWS decides something runs afoul of their intricate terms of use, we would be in trouble. What would happen? Well Blot is easy to deploy on a linux server. I would probably move to another provider, say Linode. What would break? Sites with A records pointing to Amazon's IP address would no longer resolve. Sites with CNAME records pointing to our hostname (blot.im) would continue to work.

I don't make backups of the data on the system outside AWS. I should really do this, even if it's only weekly. AWS makes it fairly expensive to move the quanity of data Blot stores, which is one thing I resent about their service (it seems *strategic* to me).

*Solutions*:
- Control my own hardware
- Run my own hardware in my own building

## Service provider issues



## Legal issues

## Personel issues

Blot is still vulnerable if I get hit by a bus. Since the source code is public, it would be possible for those who liked Blot to 

*Solutions*: 
- Hire a full-time employee who is capable of running the site without me, write succession protocol
