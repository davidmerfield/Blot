# Marketing

I dislike marketing. I have not tried to convince anyone, ever, to use Blot. I announced [the launch of Blot](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8183498) on a forum for programmers. The people who saw that forum post have since spread the news by word-of-mouth. Every customer on Blot's books today is connected to the people who saw the launch announcement. 

## Advertising

I have not ever advertised Blot. The world is worsened by advertising. Advertising is ugly and manipulative and I will not participate. 

## Social Media

Blot does not have a presence on any of the social media platforms. 

## Discounts and promotions

I do not offer discounts. Offering a discount seems unfair to customers who pay full price. 

## Trial accounts

I also do not give out accounts for free to anyone, out of respect to my customers.
