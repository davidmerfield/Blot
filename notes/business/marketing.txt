# Marketing

I have not spent any time marketing Blot to potential customers. I announced the launch of Blot to the public on a forum for programmers. The initial customers which I recieved from that forum post then spread the product by word-of-mouth. However, I do think that marketing is important. I plan to direct more of my efforts to marketing in future, once I am more satisfied with the quality of the service itself. For now at least, Blot's growth by word-of-mouth is sufficient.

## Advertising

I have not ever advertised Blot. There are relatively benign forms of advertising, like the bulletin board at your grocer's. However, I think the world would look better without advertising. Less ugly, much calmer. So I won't advertise.  

## Social Media

Blot does not have a presence on any of the social media platforms.

## Discounts and promotions

I do not offer discounts on Blot. I know that it makes business sense for me to run sales and offer promotions. However, offering a temporary discount seem unfair to customers who had paid full price. The price now is the lowest price it will ever be, and everybody who uses Blot pays it.

## Trial accounts

I also do not give out accounts for free to anyone, out of respect to my customers.
