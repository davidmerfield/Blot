# Marketing

I dislike marketing. I have not tried to convince anyone, ever, to use Blot. I announced [the launch of Blot](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8183498) on a forum for programmers. The people who saw that forum post have since spread the news by word-of-mouth. Every customer on Blot's books today is connected to those people who saw the launch announcement. 

## Advertising

I have not ever advertised Blot. The world is worsened by advertising. Advertising is ugly and manipulative and I will not participate. I tried to make Blot as good as it could be and trusted that people who liked it would share it themselves.

## Social Media

Blot does not have a presence on any of the social media platforms. 

## Discounts and promotions

I do not offer discounts. Offering a discount seem unfair to customers who pay full price. Blot will never cost less than whatever price it costs today. Everybody who wants to use Blot must pay it.

## Trial accounts

I also do not give out accounts for free to anyone, out of respect to my customers. If you want to use Blot, you must pay for your account. I'm always willing to refund people who sign up and then decide Blot is not for them.

## Desperate idea

One of the desperate ideas I had in the past, was to cold-email a number of prominent people and demo them Blot. I decided against this since it seemed undignified.
