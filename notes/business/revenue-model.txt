# Revenue model

I will sell the service to the people who want to host their blog on Blot. I will not generate income in any other way. The cost of the service is slightly higher than the average amount I spend on the infrastructure needed to host your blog, returning a profit with pays for the people who work on Blot. 


## How did you decide the price?


I set the price of Blot at whatever I would be comfortable paying myself. When I started Blot, it cost $1 a month. I've improved Blot since then and now Blot costs $4 a month. I feel that's still a fair price since I provide web hosting and personal support. I know I could get away with charging more. However, I'm interested in having Blot in the hands of more people, even if it means generating less revenue. 

## Investment

I do not plan to raise investment in Blot. Since I opened Blot to the public, it has been profitable and it remains profitable. I'm sure it makes business sense to raise money but I like how things are going.
