<h1>About</h1>

<p>Blot is a tool you can use to make a website. It's an open source publishing platform. Blot can generate a website from files and folders. The websites generated by Blot resemble those created by other content-management-systems. But there's no publishing interface, no forms to fill out. Just drag-and-drop. </p>
