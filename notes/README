About
=====

Blot turns a folder into a website.  It's a blogging platform with no interface. 
  Files in­side your site’s folder be­come posts au­to­mat­i­cally.
  Blot exists so that you can publish a website with your fa­vorite tools. Use your fa­vorite
  text-ed­i­tor to write and Blot does the rest.


## Why does Blot exist?


  I like the simplicity and durability of plain text files. For years I’ve used
  text files to store my notes. One day I realized that those text files
  had enough information –  in their contents and metadata – to
  generate a complete site, without interfering with the structure of my notes  or my writing process. So I made Blot.



## Why does Blot cost money?


  Your subscription pays for the infrastructure which hosts your site. It also covers the cost of
  providing support. Most importantly, it means Blot operates in your best
  interests alone, rather than those of advertisers or investors.

  dedicated to the public domain.


## Multiple sites


  You can manage multiple sites from the same account. Each sites is independent:
  you could use <a href="/how/sync/dropbox">Dropbox</a> with one and
  <a href="/how/sync/git">Git</a> with another. Multiple sites can use the same
  Dropbox account, or different accounts.



## Can I pay annually instead of monthly?

  Yes, once you have signed up for Blot you can switch your billing interval from once per month to once per year on the <a href="/account/subscription">subscription page</a>.


## Subscription renewals

  If you pay for Blot annually, we will email you one week before your subscription is renewed to give you time to cancel your subscription or update your billing information. If you forget
  to cancel in time, <a href="/support">contact support</a> and we'll send you a
  refund.


## Payment processing

  Blot uses <a rel="nofollow" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> to process subscription

  <a href="/account/subscription">account page</a>. You can choose to
  <a href="/account/subscription/delete">delete your account</a> immediately, or

## Bandwidth and storage limits

  There is a soft cap of 1TB of bandwidth + storage combined per year, per site.
  If you exceed this, we will ask you to meet the cost of hosting your site, or we will help you set up Blot on your own server. Note that your site is not affected by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://apps.google.com/supportwidget/articlehome?hl=en&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Fa%2Fanswer%2F7338880%3Fhl%3Den&assistant_event=welcome&assistant_id=mega-bot-shared-drive&product_context=7338880&product_name=UnuFlow&trigger_context=a">Google Drive</a> or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/security/banned-links#traffic">Dropbox’s</a
  > traffic limits because Blot hosts the contents of your folder on its own server.
