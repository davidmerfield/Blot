First make sure that requests to blot.development go to localhost. You can't just use the hosts file since it doesn't support wildcard entries. I followed this guide so user subdomains work as expected:

It involved installing Dnsmasq using homebrew, then configuring it to resolve all requests to .development to localhost. Then I had to tell OSX's DNS resolver to pass requests to .development to Dnsmasq. Phew!

## Install notes:

### Dnsmasq

When doing `brew install dnsmasq`, the `brew link dnsmasq` was unable to
complete due to /usr/local/sbin not being writable. Running `brew doctor`
revealed that /usr/local/sbin does not exist and gave the following commands to
run:

```
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/sbin
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/sbin
```

which allowed `brew link dnsmasq` to work.

Then, edited the config file at /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf to add the line:

```
address=/development/127.0.0.1
```

The command to start dnsmasq: `sudo brew services start dnsmasq`

Per the article, restarting should be like:

```
sudo launchctl stop homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq
sudo launchctl start homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq
```

Then, used `dig` to test: `dig blot.development @127.0.0.1`

### macOS

Directory didn't exist, needed to be made: `sudo mkdir -p /etc/resolver`

Add file:

```
sudo tee /etc/resolver/development >/dev/null <<EOF
nameserver 127.0.0.1
EOF
```

Check DNS still works:

```
ping -c 1 google.com
ping -c 1 blot.development
```
