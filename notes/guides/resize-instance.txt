AWS now seems to allow the in-place resize of volumes attached to its modern instances (which Blot uses). I have been following the guide to [resizing a volume on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html?icmpid=docs_ec2_console)

I also read the page on the [limitations to modifying volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/limitations.html) and none seem to apply to my case. One thing to be aware of is the delay between subsequent modifications.

> In general, use the following steps when modifying a volume:

  1. Issue the modification command. For more information, see Modifying an EBS Volume from the Console and Modifying an EBS Volume from the Command Line.

  2. Monitor the progress of the modification. For more information, see Monitoring the Progress of Volume Modifications.

  3. If the size of the volume was modified, extend the volume's file system to take advantage of the increased storage capacity. For more information, see Extending a Linux File System after Resizing the Volume .

These are the steps I followed specifically:

1. Before re-sizing the instance, create a snapshot of the running instance on the AWS dashboard. This might take a while, since Blot's volumes are decently large. If something goes wrong, you can create a new volume from a snapshot and then attach it to Blot's instance.

2. I then resized the volume attached to the Blot instance on the web console. I verified that the instance and volume types could be resized in place (as the server ran) safely. I waited for the modification to complete then sshed into the instance.

3. I used 'df -h' and 'lsblk' to verify that while the volume had increased in size, the partition that was mounted was still at the previous capacity.

4. To resize the partition, I used these two commands:

sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1
sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1

5. I then verified the success of these commands using 'df -h', the partition



Notes
-----

I wasn't aware of these commands before performing the resize. According to the manual, growpart extend a partition in a partition table to fill available space. I probably should have used '--dry-run'.


PREVIOUS GUIDES:
----------------

1. Go to Blot's running instance and create a new amazon machine image (Actions > Image > Create image)
   This will be used to launch a new instance with the same disk?

2. Create new instance with larger disk.
  Set up nginx with letsencrypt
  verify it works with staging domain (blot.is?)
  Ensure it has keys and can transfer files from old instance with scp

3. Switch to maintenance state on old instance
nano config/flags.json
sudo stop blot && sudo start blot

4. Backup db on Blot
node scripts/backup.js

5. On the new instance sync blog folders:
rsync -avL --progress -e "ssh -i /var/www/blot/config/secrets/projects.pem" ec2-user@blot.im:/var/www/blot/blogs/* /var/www/blot/blogs

6.On the new instance, sudo copy acros redis dump:
sudo stop redis
scp -i /var/www/blot/config/secrets/projects.pem ec2-user@blot.im:/var/www/blot/db/dump.rdb /var/www/blot/db/dump.rdb
sudo start redis

7. Verify it is up to date

8. Switch elastic IP from old db to new DB

# Upgrade process for EC2

1. create snapshot of disk of old instance
2. associate this with new instance
3. get new instance up and running and verified
   - ensure ssh files are there as needed
   - ensure permissions are set correctly
   - ensure config.json is set correctly

4. switch old instance to maintenance mode
5. bgSAVE old instance
6. copy old instance (now read only in maintenance) dump file to new instance disk
6. reload new instance DB with new dump file
7. switch elastic IP to new instance
8. blot should now be running in NEW MODE
