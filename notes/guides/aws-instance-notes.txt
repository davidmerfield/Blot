At the moment I have moved Blot to an I3 instance which has 16GB of RAM, a 500GB SSD hardrive for temporary data.

The 500GB harddrive is what Amazon calls an 'instance store'. It should not be depended on. When the instance reboots the data on it is lost, I believe.

I think it might be a good idea to use it as a cache. I should also move my EBS data to a cheaper (non-ssd)drive. Then I can use the SSD drive that comes with the i3 instance.

The I3 instance offers volatile storage.

3/3/2018 I have since set up the instance store as a cache.

I followed these steps to set up the disk to use as a cache:

I don't really care about write speed (as opposed to read speed) but here is a guide for optimizing write performance on instance stores:

Did some 'hardening' using the following guide:

https://www.rackaid.com/blog/how-to-block-ssh-brute-force-attacks/

I installed fail2ban:

sudo yum install fail2ban
sudo service start fail2ban

I added firewall rules on port 22 to prevent ssh brute force:

sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -i eth0 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -i eth0 -m state --state NEW -m recent  --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 -j DROP

This ensures the IP tables rules persist across restart:

sudo service iptables save
