Fix [John](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/1667fb50c0ae5742) and Nash's rename bugs.

Fix [Anders](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/1661bcc946b4960a) image path bug. A file titled "_på besøg hos gomorgen danmark.jpg" cannot be embedded in a blog post. Write test which ensures this doesn't happen again. This should also fix bug with case-sensitive paths to thumbnails + Dropbox client and tell Jan-Erik on Twitter DMs. Make resolve work more impressively, attempt to resolve a path in a case insensitive manner. Or is this a good idea? Maybe we should only resolve paths which match stored metadata? Or should we make a best-effort? As long as we are resolving case-only it should be fine... Tell [Michael](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1665ddc4057851cf) it now works. This should also fix bug with accents in image paths for [Wesley](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/15f65ae5c00af8a1). Incorporate retries into the thumbnail fetcher...

Fix [Kevin](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1665be131ce98928)'s URL encoding bug. Each entry's url property is not encoded as a URI component on the server but it needs to be.

Work out elegant way to produce fully qualified SRCs and HREFs for blogs to help make RSS feeds work more effectively, then tell [Jack](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#sent/1635d38b65e4660a), [Sven](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/16408973039dcfec), [Kevin](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1665be131ce98928) and [Will](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/164050fdc323b358) about the fix, which affects people who use micro.blog. Also tell [Michael](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1667c931e1142332) who is hardcoding his domain. Also tell [Jaco](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/166911c96525df43)

- Fix bug with cache not busting for static rendered themes:
  1. put posts in blog
  2. sync, create view e.g. static.js which renders all_entries
  3. remove posts from blog
  4. reload page, static.js still shows the entries, which archives.html does not

- Read and write package.json for local editing, then tell [Aurynn](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1588e3df7489b554) and [Brian](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/16409a32f8246597) know when it's possible to set variables locally

Template selection
- feed - general purpose
- photos - optimized for a photoblog
- archive - optimized for an archive of photos, links, quotes
- essays - optimized for longform essays
- code - optimized for a developer's blog
- portfolio - optimized for a portfolio of visual work
- magazine - optimized for a magazine

Find good source of material, ideally on Blot like this [source for theme content](http://cinebloc.blot.im/)

Investigate [Jekyll themes to use](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss) which have permissive licenses

Record a new demo video
- Show sites I run using Blot
- "Bring your own interface"
  - show demo of simple custom text editor built in electron or something which has autocomplete tags, drag and drop images, explain that you can build something like this yourself.
- Blot's developer blog, a conventional blog, show using different text editors
- My visual scrapbook: shows tag folders, photo blog
- My link blog: shows the webloc feature, shows IFFFT, perhaps from favourited tweets?
- My personal site: simple landing page, edit with a doc file?

Move to using unix socket with redis client per [documentation](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis) for better throughput. [Read this issue first](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis/issues/204), I might need to make some user group permissions tweaks to ensure things are secure.

Increase default quality for sharp's output images

Client.write does not propogate sync errors... to demonstrate this, revoke dropbox token then try to enable local editing.

Re-enable image minifier and fix the bugs it creates
  
Can we keep the pandoc child_process running and pipe stuff in and out for speed? Measure before after to ensure this helps

Generate screenshots as thumbnails for webloc posts perhaps using [pupeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) and PNG8, which seems [efficient for screenshots](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18236912)

Move to Linode
- Preserve AWS elastic IP and proxy to Linode
- Think about eventual multiple locations around the world from day 1
- Work out the [pricing model carefully](https://www.linode.com/pricing)
- Use [blockstorage this for storing all users' folders](https://www.linode.com/blockstorage)
- Use [backups](https://www.linode.com/backups)
- Use [nodebalancers](https://www.linode.com/nodebalancers)

Prune package.json
- To [minify HTML](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier)
- To [minify CSS](https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano) [(alternative)](https://github.com/css/csso)
- To [minify JavaScript](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) [(alternative)](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/)

Cluster the main process. How will I verify that there is not statefullness somewhere in the server? I also want the main 'server' running on different threads to the CPU intensive stuff like image processing. Will this fix the bug with additional child processes if main process runs out of memory? Something wasn't being killed during the Nash WAV bug of August, 2018. There were duplicate node rebuild processes running.

Distribute static built blogs on [dat](https://github.com/datproject/dat-node) or something similar

Ensure the nginx service can be controlled properly using Upstart. It seems like Monit's attempts to reboot the service which failed, caused the downtime. Potentially worth reviewing commands in this: https://gist.github.com/andmej/1953239

Add an EXPIRY to the log entries for a blog's 404 log

Use a [redis analysis tool](https://github.com/snmaynard/redis-audit) to see if I can squeeze more out of REDIS

Look into mirroring site across multiple domains and follow up with Thomas
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/1625012def221a8f

Move to cool user subdomains
 - Pretty to proper blog IDs instead of integers

Public site
- Log 404s on the public site to identify neccessary redirects
- Personalize the documentation for logged in users
- Add a resource page to the documentation with guides like this:
  - https://twitter.com/chad_g_moore/status/975104556001583104?s=20
- Inline all CSS for performance
- Render the formatting guide navigation on the server

Developer documentation
  - Make reference page searchable
  - Add types and examples to items on reference page
  - Work how to explain the archives property

Self-hosting documentation then tell [Jake](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/1659d67326849fb3) and [Mohammed](https://twitter.com/mnafees_me/status/1051121206030753794?s=12)

Investigate static site search offerings
- It would be nice to have one whose index you could build on 
  the server, and deliver statically, perhaps even chunked if it was huge
- Would be nice to be able to patch updates to this index quickly without
  rebuilding the whole thing

Template
- Add support for 'Template' folder and a way to copy this to dashboard?

- How do we share info, like a link on a menu, or a header image across themes? Could there be a shared info repository that themes could access?

- add support for dynamic partials to make collections possible, e.g. {{> /{tag}.html}} ?

- Add neat interface to customize blog level variables?

- How do we transition from a global menu to one that the themes have control over? How do we share existing links between themes? How do we deal with the order of pages in a user's folder?

- How do we transition from a global date display format to one that themes have control over?

- Change url?json=true to debug=true?

- Port the jekyll theme [Neocactus](https://github.com/mmarfil/neocactus/) to Blot and document the process
  then tell [Robert](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/16288ce117d980e4)

- Finish Ghost theme import for [Kingi](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/1625fdd572e72c69)
- Draw simple abstract representations of each theme for the themes page to replace thumbnails
- Install and test a few of these static site generators:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17942395
- Make themes file or folder based
- Consider making file-based theme directory a git repo and using this to implement basic undo-redo functionality. 
- Disable re-rendering for locals
- Add better customization options
- Local theme editing does not clear cache
- Use Hogan for precompiling and rendering themes?
- Parse tokens and params from routes and tell [Jason](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/163186d43aaf52af)
- Add way to allow all entry lists to access {{#months}} sorting options just like the archives page.
- Fix [Frank](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/1527fbcf999ba0c3)'s strange theme bug
- Warn users that underscore will not work for hidden pages
- Fix _ entries to true public files, tell john & other folks who depend on the menu: yes, page: no side effect
- Tell [Rodrigo](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1564a13991197f63) don't write previews for _ posts
- Add support for fetching only some properties of an entry (ideally only those that are used). prevent some properties from being fetched in some lists (html, for example in all_entries). Would be a good candidate for hgetall or hget?


Dashboard
- Offering a broken link checker service
- Dumb quotes are still smartified, even without typeset enabled.
- Tolerate missing 'www' in personal domain field on dashboard for users with a custom domain when checking validity
- Can we trim the homepage to get to this?
                          
  - Title                 ________________  
  - Domain                | Your folder  |
  - Theme                 |              |
  - Photo                 |              |
  - URLs                  |______________|
  - Dates

  Menu, Dates, Disqus, Analytics etc. would be customized per theme
  Services page would be phased out, perhaps introducing metadata flags, e.g.
     Typeset: no
     Katex: no
  Or global flags in something like config.json. Would be rare though.
  Client would be a link at the bottom corner of the folder. Synced by Dropbox (edit)

- Generate SSL cert for www subdomain of apex domain pointed to Blot, and redirect it to apex domain. Tell [Paul](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/164423db2ef130b0)
- Implement a flags page for toggling all the settings (including hidden ones) for a given blog
- Route requests to new dashboard if toggle is on to allow thorough testing
- When a user pastes the whole tracking script into the preferences page on the dashboard,
strip out everything except the ID which we need... perhaps create a page explaining what
is happening before doing this.
- Handle noscript on dashboard / signup gracefully (remove all dashboard js?)
- Allow users who are restarting an account with multiple blogs to disable some before restarting.
- Take a look at Notion and Cargo for some neat ideas
- Disabling a blog should free up the domain and handle associated
- Removing a domain from a blog does NOT delete the domain:example.com key from redis. meaning if a user sets a domain once, it's effectively theirs forever. This is a bug!

File converters / codecs
- Video posts (.mp4)
- OPML files and tell [John](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/1659bac084c3e404)
- Audio posts (.mp3 for now?)

- Multi-file posts with the same name but different extension (image.txt and image.jpg)
- Markdown
  Write a pandoc compatible markdown converter in javascript
  to resolve some of the performance issues with pandoc
  Perhaps just use https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it
- Add support for checkboxes and tell [Matt](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/16409435477f6206) and [Shridhar](https://twitter.com/shridhargupta/status/1053769475063857152)

Internationalize i8n
- Tell Christian about [Portuguese](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/1646ff9a7cbf6971)
Clients
- SFTP
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/ftpd
- Google Drive
  Tell Cecil: https://twitter.com/Blot__/status/988162892594860032?s=20
  Tell Jonathan: https://twitter.com/chin_jon/status/1032392398473650176

Allow Blot to fallback to client.read if the file does not exist on the blot server. Say the harddrive is wiped, we still would like to serve blog files

Sync
- Re-implement folder verification feature and make use of the local content hash computation script to verify we have the correct version of a given file
- Make the sync / rebuild proceses run with unpriviledged user permissions to ensure shit isnt fucked with user input...
– Re-instate feature to check if a rogue sync took down the server and run sync on a seperate process
- Add method to pause syncing and prevent future syncs
then use this method with the create/remove blog migration too.
- Ensure sync script is run by less priveledged user (just access to /tmp ? /blogs/{{ID}})?

Increase price for new customers to $40 a year. This will not affect existing customers.

Buy the .com
- Remember to bump LetsEncrypt rate limits if needed
- Remember to transfer Dropbox webhooks to new domain on the Dropbox developers console

- Let [Logan](https://twitter.com/blot__/status/962762284782243842) know

Increase price for new customers to $60 a year. This will not affect existing customers.

Git client:
- Backdate existing commits (perhaps set file ctime using info from git log?) This would sidestep the frustration experienced by [Gavin](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1669a8e621f9ef37) when he imported an existing repository.
- Extend sync lock during long syncs
- Write test to simulate process dying and restarting mid-pull. Does the client recover? What happens if a pull fails midway? Does git recover?
- Write tests for a series of random client operations (pull, add, push, move, reset, delete) that can be seeded and reliably re-run in the case of failure.
- Move to neat promise chain api when 2.0 comes out
* Test that client must keep sending new entries and deleted entries when it recieved an error from entry.build otherwise you get ghost posts...
- send nice error message with instructions for 413 request too large: "git reset HEAD^" etc...
- Thoroughly document:
  - write
- - read
  - sync
- Tidy up tests and reduce size and runtime
- Add documentation and an explanation for how to mirror blot blog repo on Github or Gitlab:
  https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/1658e28be94479af
- This client should acquire a lock on the blog's folder before doing stuff to it more generally, especially during initialization etc...
- what happens if user changes their handle? will pushing break?
  - I want them to be able to keep using their old one *until* someone else claims it, then I want 401 unauthorized, please reauthenticate with new username... but the remote path will be wrong?
- Rate limit authentication route?

Dropbox client:
- Adding an additional blog to existing app folder under constant webhooks failed. New blog had correct folder but old blog still used root. I guess we need to acquire a lock on ALL blogs interacting with that dropbox account.
- Extend sync lock during long syncs
- Write test to simulate process dying and restarting mid-pull. Does the client recover? 
- Write tests for a series of random dropbox client operations (pull, add, push, move, reset, delete) that can be seeded and reliably re-run in the case of failure.
- Look into getAccessTokenFromCode on DBSDK repo to avoid the mess in get_account.js https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-js/issues/64
- Gracefuly retry wrapper around Dropbox
- Can we write to a folder_id instead of a path? It would be nice to be able to move the blog's folder even when writing the initial files to it, for example...
- This should be simple once we copy the exisiting state of the blog folder across. But right now it doesn't really do much. It resets the local server folder. Then resyncs.
- Update to latest version of Dropbox client.
- Make the folder in Dropbox rename automatically when the
user changes the username for one of their multiple blogs?


Support 2FA (Two factor authentication)
- Tell [Luke](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/163993b0f8499ab3)

Add support for entry property with escaped double quotes, tell [Jay](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/15e396dbd8350972)

NGINX
- Improve error pages
- Recompile nginx with neccessary dependencies for auto-ssl instead of openresty
- Install nginx fail2ban & http2

Support linking to another blog post by its *file path*
- This would help with the importer to fix broken links

Generative tree
- Add a generative tree illustration to account page that is 'seeded' when you sign up and grows as you keep your account open. Slowly, day by day. Would still be growing in 1000 years should your account stay open that long.
- Learn about old trees
- Learn how to make a generative illustration and render it quickly on the server
- I like this idea because it's sort of anti-Farmville (i.e. click-to-grow, engage-to-grow). The tree just grows. No badgering to post more to keep the tree alive, all you have to do is keep your account. When you delete your account you just see the tree, and a thank you. Obviously don't do anything tacky like cut the tree down or anything. That would be horrible.

Removing Date metadata from a post should reset its date to the file's creation date
- Currently nothing changes.

Add support for 'time' metadata property
- Useful for posts with path-based-dates.
- e.g. 'Time: 4:15pm'
- Would append to any other date associated with the post.

Download the webpage for bookmark files and try to extract title + summary

Add a file dependency / dependents list to each entry then use this to rebuild dependent entries when, for example, a public image is updated.

Add support for comments via webmentions

Thumbnail generator
- Improve transformer so it checks a file's MTIME against a stored value before rehashing the file
- Generate thumbnails for GIFs / SVG thum
- Prioritize faces
- Aim to generate distinct thumbnails across the blog
- Try to crop out ruined borders. E.g. when making a square crop of a rectangular image with a border, crop into the image as well to remove the border-on-three-sides effect
- Extract color palette too for the image
- Run quickly first time, then run in the background to pick the best thumbnail
- Offer imgix style API for embedding thumbnails

Migrate code from require('mime') to require('mime-types') since it doesn't use a global default type. Remove the mime node module.

Move off the CDN
- Work out why blotcdn is so slow for https://latency.apex.sh
- Backup s3 buckets every day? delete those older than a month?

Migrate code from require('../../../') to shortcuts in node_modules

Remove the dirToModule code and hard link the require references.

Use \<select\> optgroup on timezone select dropdown to subdivide zones by current time, and steal the presentation format used by basecamp.

Backups
- Add hourly local redis rdb dumps
- Add script to roll back into hourly local db dumps and remote backups
- Delete backups older than a month from s3 automatically

Add daemon for zero-downtime node restart
