GUID bugs:
- Fix duplicate GUID issue and tell [Jason](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGrbvKsNQgVWVNKrVqMzRJdDvKk)

- [ ] dropbox reset TO BLOT should handle removed folder
- [ ] dropbox reset FROM BLOT should handle removed folder
- [ ] dropbox reset TO BLOT should handle revoked token
- [ ] dropbox reset FROM BLOT should handle revoked token
- [ ] make google drive reset TO store metadata for case of file/folder name

Improve Google Drive client:
- How do we handle two files with same name and same parent? How does our fileId:path hash handle this? Make sure we delete the right file. Will file.title as opposed to file.name give us the deduped version?
  - Bug: move file with deduplicated name from sub folder to other folder
  - download should check for an existing file with same name but different fileId and dedupe before storing the path?
- Handle revoked credentials without tanking server
- Can the google drive client handle a server restart during setup?
- database.folder should throw ENOENT and EEXIST errors for del, set, move etc.
- Error handling
  - Retry when we get google drive's This service is not available error
  - Handle storage quota errors
  - Handle 429 errors with exponential backoff retry
- Implement `folder.rename` method to take advantage of Google Drive's true rename feature
- Add a way for sync/build to accept a ctime as an option. We can't set this at the operating system level but google drive's API does return a createdTime value and we could use this as the true file's created date, rather than the date the file is made on the server
- `write` should use the best method for large file uploading
- Work out if we can test this using Mocks

Improvements to Dropbox client:
- [ ] Determine if we can hack our way to determining the file upload date on Dropbox using their API?
- [ ] Parallelize build/download a little more, so posts appear when many files are dropped into folder?
- [ ] Efficiently handle Dropbox file renames with internal hash of fileIDs
- [ ] surface errors during setup on dashboard
   - [ ] surface sync issues with Dropbox client on the homepage of dashboard
   - [ ] How do we make errors sticky? To make sure users click through to clients page to re-connect to Dropbox, etc...
- [ ] run reset-to-blot when sync fails / errors
- [ ] ensure that when a process dies, any blogs syncing will be reset-to-blot
- [ ] ensure that when a process dies, any blogs setting up db client will be re-attempted
- [ ] reconnecting with the same account and same permissions should not create a new folder for `full_access=true`
- [ ] make full_folder use the old app folder directory – is there a way to disconnect it from the Blot app? otherwise add a big warning to prevent confusion about where the new folder is when transitioning permissions
- [ ] handle the download of large files gracefully too
- [ ] consider adding back in download/upload stream, but add a check to see if the download is stuck then fall back to other method?
- [ ] add a check for folder storage before doing mass upload
- [ ] handle folder full error appropriately
- [ ] handle a sync lock failure on second blog when migrating an app folder
- [ ] check content hash for upload possible

Improvements to dashboard:
- Smooth over the custom domain adding process
  - cache domain validity and display checkmark on dashboard
  - validate the domain is pointing to Blot before allowing resty-auto-ssl to request a cert. we seem to get into a DNS mismatch where a client thinks a domain points to Blot, and triggers a cert request through resty-auto-ssl but whatever DNS server Blot's server points to has the stale record (pointing elsewhere)

- Make it [possible for users to select length of teasers](https://blot.im/questions/823) and [Leo](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGqQJdjwTLkHkRZvZTQvfSzSFTq)

Performance improvements
- Consider switching redis client, perhaps to ioredis?
- Use a docker image to speed up test suite: https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/pull/463
- Faster server, with SSL termination across CDN
- set up 'cdn.blot.im' as cloudfront distribution endpoint?
- Streamline and cache loading of data on dashboard
- Ensure node.js server has one process per CPU
- Detect CPU intensive functions in node.js process
- Use the [--trace-sync-io command-line flag](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html#set-node_env-to-production) to determine if Blot is using any sync methods inappropriately
- Can we keep the pandoc child_process running and pipe stuff in and out for speed? Measure before after to ensure this helps
- Add request level timeouts to prevent server swamping
  - ensure to remove the timeout from the SSE streaming routes (drafts, sync status on dashboard)
  - read this guide: http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/timeout.html
  - it seems we also need to cancel the resources involved in responding to the request (i.e. disk io, db calls) for this to be really useful
  - Add a timeout of 15 seconds for building posts.

Server changes
- Write useful benchmark tool for Blot
- Work out how to detect stray build processes. There were a bunch of zombies consuming memory on Blot's server. Work out how to kill them safely
- Experiment with different EBS types, perhaps try to use ephemeral disk more since lower latency?
- Take full advantage of attached SSD
  - use rsync/inotify to synchronize 'source of truth' EBS disk with the local SSD cache then modify NGINX to check the synced folder on the /cache disk
  - on boot we would gently copy across all /blogs folders and the /static directory in background task

-  Persist data somehow? import/export from local folder .blot?
-  Fix 'Visit' link on dashboard
-  Can we expand this to a simple self-hosting process ('npx blot-server')?

Template engine plan
- create data/blogs/blogID/templates directory
- show error message on preview-of subdomain
- only allow valid templates to get stored in data/blogs/blogID/templates, used for live site?
  - maybe we only store in redis valid templates, live site pulls

- Fix summary generator such that a subtitle is used for summary text (i.e. an h2 directly following an h1) We still want to prevent the scenario in which a later h2 becomes the summary, though. Notify [Jessica and rebuild Jessica's site](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/KtbxLwghhxtxrtdGHFqBRMcDGkGWtxvSdq)

  - email notifications (There's an existing system in place for sending emails in app/helper/email)  
  - upvoting for topics and upvote-based ranking on the topic index
  - show vote count and answer count next to each question on index

Redirect URLs with trailing slash when possible (i.e. not directory browsing) to [fix possible duplicate content penalties](https://moz.com/community/q/duplicate-content-with-a-trailing-slash) and tell [Marius](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwKkHhPFPKFBzQjQQHwlrRWwbKq)
- Add rel=canonical to all the default templates, or fix the issue that Blot serves the same thing to URLs with a trailing slash, and without. 
- If we do add rel=canonical, make sure to consider the situation where someone mounts a page to the index of their site, e.g. /page/1 and / will now be different.

Add way to nest tags / hierarchy for tags and tell [Uzoamaka](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwLsJwTqFWjRgHLhPXJgBtnGwJJ)

Adjust the chargeForRemaining function in create-blog such that the balance is added or deducted from the proration charge.

Rewrite transformer (in app/helper/transformer)
- Speak HTTP properly, respect backoffs, use/send eTags
- Share information across blogs?
- Improve transformer so it checks a file's MTIME against a stored value before rehashing the file?
- Adjust interface to accept a number of directories. Make it 'unaware' of blog IDs?
- Add method which accepts a path or URL and flushes what is stored for it, update the rebuild entry script
- Cache errors. When a post contains multiple identical links to images that timeout/404, the thumbnail generator should only make 1 attempt to fetch them. Right now we have a post that is filled with identical broken image links (in this case to a spacer.gif) can suck up the build process for hours. 

Add a 'page link format' option to the dashboard – the link format now only applies to entries. Tell [Mike](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwKkbjLjgTZLQqMFFMzBBpzMZTg)

Experiment with GitHub actions setup
- Look into potentially useful actions for code quality / linting / automtatic dependency updates
  - [super-linter](https://github.com/github/super-linter#how-it-works)?

Improvements to server infrastructure
- Work out way to recover from expired cert in the cache. To reproduce, consider a member who signed up, connected example.com, then moved the domain to another service. The attempt to renew the cert for example.com will fail. When the customer re-registers with Blot, for some reason open-resty-auto-ssl will serve an old certificate. I followed these steps to [reset](https://github.com/GUI/lua-resty-auto-ssl/issues/42) but we should automate this
- Create DMARC record for Blot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/dmarc.html
- NGINX doesn't appear to be following the symlinks created by node.js to serve the contents of each blog's folder and the contents of each blog's static directory. Is this a permissions issue? Is now finally the time to set up users with appropriate permissions for blot, nginx, build etc...

Improve the automatic title generated for screenshots with default MacOs filename from 'at 14:40pm'

Add support for posts generated from Excel files, would generate a table. Use [this library](https://github.com/joshboyan/excel-to-html-table)?

Work out how to cache 404s at the NGINX level
- I tried extending express-disk-cache to store images inside /https/blot.im/missing/foo-bar.html but I can't set a 404 status code for the specific tryfiles directive which could match that file.
- The application server ends up spending a lot of time serving 404s

Improvements to entry builder
- Adjust title metadata extractor to fallback to file name rather than first sentence of file if the post does not contain a title tag. The current behaviour has suprised a number of people.

Look into accessibility issues with scrolling and code blocks and tell [Eli](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGtwqJjjrrGHDWjLPzfxGpnkZTh) if I make any changes

Improvements to Git client
- Add support for LFS and tell [Jamie](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwBVMcpnxGHqnxJHNdbMBSrglzg)
- Remove git folder when switching to Dropbox client and tell [Jamie](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwGDDqlwPCNcJrLDqprtcKWXFTn)
- Backdate existing commits (perhaps set file ctime using info from git log?) This would sidestep the frustration experienced by [Gavin](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1669a8e621f9ef37) when he imported an existing repository.
- Fix bugs with git removed / renamed file unit test on Travis
- Extend sync lock during long syncs
- Write test to simulate process dying and restarting mid-pull. Does the client recover? What happens if a pull fails midway? Does git recover?
- Write tests for a series of random client operations (pull, add, push, move, reset, delete) that can be seeded and reliably re-run in the case of failure.
- Move to neat promise chain api when 2.0 comes out
* Test that client must keep sending new entries and deleted entries when it recieved an error from entry.build otherwise you get ghost posts...
- send nice error message with instructions for 413 request too large: "git reset HEAD^" etc...
- Thoroughly document:
- Tidy up tests and reduce size and runtime
- This client should acquire a lock on the blog's folder before doing stuff to it more generally, especially during initialization etc...
- what happens if customer changes their handle? will pushing break?
  - I want them to be able to keep using their old one *until* someone else claims it, then I want 401 unauthorized, please reauthenticate with new username... but the remote path will be wrong?
- Rate limit authentication route?

Dropbox client
- Handle file renames using Dropbox IDs to avoid the 'new entry' bug when you rename a file
- Build posts incrementally while big syncs are taking place 
- Revert lowercase for all files when disconnecting the client
- add support for Dropbox Paper files using paperDocsDownload and tell [Emad](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwHMZJvMswZZXKvLfBRBVqfzksw)
- Add integration test with a dropbox Webhook call. I want to not push some code which would prevent syncing customer folders.
- Does client.remove support the removal of folders? If not, make it so and add a test
- Add a step to authentication flow which says: 'there is already a folder called 'Your blog title' in your Dropbox, would you like to use that?' then overwrite the files inside. This prevents the proliferation of confusing 'Your blog title (1)' when you re-authenticate.
- Add a progress bar to the dashboard when writing existing files to Dropbox. It takes a while and confuses people.
- Adding an additional blog to existing app folder under constant webhooks failed. New blog had correct folder but old blog still used root. I guess we need to acquire a lock on ALL blogs interacting with that dropbox account.
- Extend sync lock during long syncs
- Write test to simulate process dying and restarting mid-pull. Does the client recover?
- Write tests for a series of random dropbox client operations (pull, add, push, move, reset, delete) that can be seeded and reliably re-run in the case of failure.
- Look into getAccessTokenFromCode on DBSDK repo to avoid the mess in get_account.js https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-js/issues/64
- Gracefuly retry wrapper around Dropbox
- Can we write to a folder_id instead of a path? It would be nice to be able to move the blog's folder even when writing the initial files to it, for example...
- This should be simple once we copy the exisiting state of the blog folder across. But right now it doesn't really do much. It resets the local server folder. Then resyncs.
- Update to latest version of Dropbox client.
- Make the folder in Dropbox rename automatically when the
customer changes the username for one of their multiple blogs?

Add media-query to prevent typeset hanging punctuation on small screens (it looks weird) and tell [Shibel](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwCgpXqMzwcBGWgjxgpcpCnMCQW)

Make Redis performance improvements
- Research [Redis clustering](http://highscalability.com/blog/2019/2/19/intro-to-redis-cluster-sharding-advantages-limitations-deplo.html)
- Prune redis keys and begin storing more on disk
- [redis analysis tool](https://github.com/snmaynard/redis-audit)
- Move to using unix socket with redis client per [documentation](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis) for better throughput. [Read this issue first](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis/issues/204), I might need to make some user group permissions tweaks to ensure things are secure.

Restructure application folder
- make serving static files from NGINX easier?
  - ln /data/blogs/{blogID}/folder /data/cache/{hostname}/folder/...
  - ln /data/blogs/{blogID}/static  /data/cache/{hostname}/static/...
- consolidating the data stored about each blog
- Specfic ideas:
  - Move cache directory from /cache to /data/cache
  - Move blog's folder contents from /blogs/{blogID} to data/blogs/{blogID}/folder
  - Move static files directory from /static/{blogID} to /data/blogs/{blogID}/static
  - Move db directory from /db to /data/db
  - Remove /tmp directory and instead use os.tmpDir

Switch to streaming JSON parser. There are npm modules that offer asynchronous JSON APIs. See for example:
- JSONStream, which has stream APIs.
- Big-Friendly JSON, which has stream APIs as well as asynchronous versions of the standard JSON APIs using the partitioning-on-the-Event-Loop paradigm outlined below.

Add notification emails for monit events
- Include secure one-time link to reboot the AWS instance?

- Add support for fetching only some properties of an entry (ideally only those that are used). prevent some properties from being fetched in some lists (html, for example in all_entries). Would be a good candidate for hgetall or hget?

Embed feature
