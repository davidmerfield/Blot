IDEAS
=====

It could be nice to link to [@path/to/file.txt] and resolve the URL automatically?
  - would need a dependency tree, if change were made to file.txt, the linker would
    need to be updated too.
  - would leave a trail, like regular permalinks, so file.txt could be moved without
    breaking anything.

Add 'opener=false' to target="_blank" links?

Consider offering a broken link checker service?

Add neat interface to customize blog level variables?

add support for dynamic partials to make collections possible
e.g. {{> /{tag}.html}} ?

Move from preview files -> webloc / .url files ?
