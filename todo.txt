- [ ] new folder setup (e.g. waiting for user to share folder on drive) needs to survive a server restart (See init.js TODO)
- [ ] slowly resync all connected blogs on server restart
- [ ] It seems like sometimes the first sentence of Google Docs become titles unexpectedly – possibly a mis-identified title tag?
- [ ] make it possible to short-circuit the full folder traversal and immediately begin at a specific file/subfolder
- [ ] to improve sync speed, eventually set up temporary channels to watch google docs for changes – is this faster than polling driveactivity? or work out the fastest way to get fast updates for google docs. Is the move to listen on changes.watch and then setup an optional temporary files.watch channel to stream changes for the length of the channel (don't renew)?
- [ ] add tests with nock
- [ ] Test multiple sites sync in parallel
- [ ] Test multiple Google Drive accounts in parallel
- [ ] On disconnect, convert Google Docs in folder into Markdown and inform the user

- Error handling
  - Retry when we get google drive's This service is not available error
  - Handle storage quota errors
  - Handle 429 errors with exponential backoff retry
- Add a way for sync/build to accept a ctime as an option. We can't set this at the operating system level but google drive's API does return a createdTime value and we could use this as the true file's created date, rather than the date the file is made on the server
- `write` should use the best method for large file uploading
- Work out if we can test this using Mocks

Prevent full disk from affecting access to people's blogs. 
- switch into a read-only mode?
  - the specific issue that takes down the server seems to be the redis error (cannot persist on disk, out of space)

Improvements to dashboard:
- Smooth over the custom domain adding process
  - cache domain validity and display checkmark on dashboard
  - validate the domain is pointing to Blot before allowing resty-auto-ssl to request a cert. we seem to get into a DNS mismatch where a client thinks a domain points to Blot, and triggers a cert request through resty-auto-ssl but whatever DNS server Blot's server points to has the stale record (pointing elsewhere)

- [ ] Talk to Marius about [his opinions on the compression settings](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwLtQPwXwJrwgMzjfvDtcwFZzFC)

Begin collecting proper measurements for page-rendering speed on the server

Add raw-link -> open graph cards/embed function, which would fetch the title, description and thumbnail for a link using <meta> tags. Tell [Robert](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGlksJFbBlWtzMHgcxcdBRBhQSJ)

Improvements to teaser generator
- Improve estimate of teaser length
- Remove trailing non-text elements (like <hr>)
- Add {{small}} and {{long}} versions of teaser?
- Fix bug with makeTeaser for ~/Dropbox/bug.html which locks main process painfully
- Internal links (e.g. #section) in {{{teaser}}} should be resolved against the entry's permalink.
- Add hasBreakpoint property to entry to allow greater control over display of {{{teaser}}} and tell [Pratik](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwBTsfMTHqWMQFmprMcjNpdBQzp)
- Fix [issue with teaser generator](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/issues/15) that locks up a build process, sometimes for 10+ seconds.
- Make it [possible for users to select length of teasers](https://blot.im/questions/823) and [Leo](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGqQJdjwTLkHkRZvZTQvfSzSFTq)

Performance improvements
- Consider switching redis client, perhaps to ioredis?
- Use a docker image to speed up test suite: https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/pull/463
- Faster server, with SSL termination across CDN
- set up 'cdn.blot.im' as cloudfront distribution endpoint?
- Streamline and cache loading of data on dashboard
- Ensure node.js server has one process per CPU
- Detect CPU intensive functions in node.js process
- Use the [--trace-sync-io command-line flag](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html#set-node_env-to-production) to determine if Blot is using any sync methods inappropriately
- Can we keep the pandoc child_process running and pipe stuff in and out for speed? Measure before after to ensure this helps
- Add request level timeouts to prevent server swamping
  - ensure to remove the timeout from the SSE streaming routes (drafts, sync status on dashboard)
  - read this guide: http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/timeout.html
  - it seems we also need to cancel the resources involved in responding to the request (i.e. disk io, db calls) for this to be really useful
  - Add a timeout of 15 seconds for building posts.

Server changes
- Write useful benchmark tool for Blot
- Work out how to detect stray build processes. There were a bunch of zombies consuming memory on Blot's server. Work out how to kill them safely
- Experiment with different EBS types, perhaps try to use ephemeral disk more since lower latency?
- Take full advantage of attached SSD
  - use rsync/inotify to synchronize 'source of truth' EBS disk with the local SSD cache then modify NGINX to check the synced folder on the /cache disk
  - on boot we would gently copy across all /blogs folders and the /static directory in background task

Add [line numbers](https://github.com/wcoder/highlightjs-line-numbers.js/) to highlight.js hljs code tags

- Write task to identify and delete long overdue customers

Fetch dimensions of images even if optimize and cache is disable, so that image zoom can work. Tell [Joshua](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwLsmhMtGvPcwxlSHSSTFVpJVbd)

Add action to lint code with jshint and eslint
  - any other static code analysis tools?
  - separate code to check for broken links, run in parallel
  
Improvements to metadata extractor:
- Improve date parser to use time from file creation date if it's within the same day as the date specified in metadata and follow up with [Nicolas](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwLsShbhKRcvhWJlKRPHPctMnWM)
- Fix summary generator such that a subtitle is used for summary text (i.e. an h2 directly following an h1) We still want to prevent the scenario in which a later h2 becomes the summary, though. Notify [Jessica and rebuild Jessica's site](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/KtbxLwghhxtxrtdGHFqBRMcDGkGWtxvSdq)
- Add support for entry property with escaped double quotes, tell [Jay](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/15e396dbd8350972)

Reduce image compression settings and tell [Joshua](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwLsmhMtGvPcwxlSHSSTFVpJVbd)

Improve questions section of site, in approximate order of importance:
  - Add way to mass-rename tags
  - Add display aliases for tags e.g. how -> How to use Blot, etc.
  - Store version history of the question and answer edits
  - give the 'ask' and 'answer' textarea inputs the full functionality of the GitHub issue/PR comment inputs (i.e. code snippets / preview / copy/paste screenshots from clipboard)
  - email notifications (There's an existing system in place for sending emails in app/helper/email)  
  - upvoting for topics and upvote-based ranking on the topic index
  - show vote count and answer count next to each question on index
  - 'run code snippet' feature / similar to trinkets.io

Add way to nest tags / hierarchy for tags and tell [Uzoamaka](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwLsJwTqFWjRgHLhPXJgBtnGwJJ)

Adjust the chargeForRemaining function in create-blog such that the balance is added or deducted from the proration charge.

Rewrite transformer (in app/helper/transformer)
- Speak HTTP properly, respect backoffs, use/send eTags
- Share information across blogs?
- Improve transformer so it checks a file's MTIME against a stored value before rehashing the file?
- Adjust interface to accept a number of directories. Make it 'unaware' of blog IDs?
- Add method which accepts a path or URL and flushes what is stored for it, update the rebuild entry script
- Cache errors. When a post contains multiple identical links to images that timeout/404, the thumbnail generator should only make 1 attempt to fetch them. Right now we have a post that is filled with identical broken image links (in this case to a spacer.gif) can suck up the build process for hours. 

Add a 'page link format' option to the dashboard – the link format now only applies to entries. Tell [Mike](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwKkbjLjgTZLQqMFFMzBBpzMZTg)

Prevent long-overdue customers from accessing the service, then tell [Matvey](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwHNgWvzTkMVZXFrSpjGfcCrWJG)

Experiment with GitHub actions setup
- Look into potentially useful actions for code quality / linting / automtatic dependency updates
  - [super-linter](https://github.com/github/super-linter#how-it-works)?

Improvements to server infrastructure
- Work out way to recover from expired cert in the cache. To reproduce, consider a member who signed up, connected example.com, then moved the domain to another service. The attempt to renew the cert for example.com will fail. When the customer re-registers with Blot, for some reason open-resty-auto-ssl will serve an old certificate. I followed these steps to [reset](https://github.com/GUI/lua-resty-auto-ssl/issues/42) but we should automate this
- Create DMARC record for Blot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/dmarc.html
- NGINX doesn't appear to be following the symlinks created by node.js to serve the contents of each blog's folder and the contents of each blog's static directory. Is this a permissions issue? Is now finally the time to set up users with appropriate permissions for blot, nginx, build etc...

Improve the automatic title generated for screenshots with default MacOs filename from 'at 14:40pm'

Add support for posts generated from Excel files, would generate a table. Use [this library](https://github.com/joshboyan/excel-to-html-table)?

Work out how to cache 404s at the NGINX level
- I tried extending express-disk-cache to store images inside /https/blot.im/missing/foo-bar.html but I can't set a 404 status code for the specific tryfiles directive which could match that file.
- The application server ends up spending a lot of time serving 404s

Re-send receipt when the customer changes their email after initial payment, pre-account creation.
- Once stripe allows programmatic receipt delivery

- Use time draft was moved into blog folder for entry created/publish date, rather than the time the draft file itself was created. Tell [Kerim](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwDrHtwmLGkWLvLfklMwRRqDpTk) and [Shibel](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwGDWsqhHZnPjfgRqFhpdNGZVKn)
- Parse Word Document subtitles as h2 and tell [Matt](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/FMfcgxwDrlfrjDMsDlkLHNsnbtmXQtDw)
- Add way to filter entries by post type (e.g. photo) and tell [Justin](https://twitter.com/juter/status/1079767534231011330).
- If entries share publish date, sort them by blot creation date
- Fix bug with blockquotes and tell [Kerim](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/165b813e36c5ad67). Multiple ">" symbols on the blank paragraphs between other quoted text are not formatting properly.
- Fix bug with indented code in pre tags and tell [Michael](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/166704e2c0187e5c)

Improvements to dashboard
- Fix bug with file list on dashboard in Safari and tell [Ryan](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwHMGHzLwclHfnvjZrvfsvTQdGf)
- Fix missing error messages on overdue subscription payment form
- Use \<select\> optgroup on timezone select dropdown to subdivide zones by current time, and steal the presentation format used by basecamp.
- Add a broken link checker
- Make dashboard requests idempotent to prevent multiple form resubmits, multiple new blogs created accidentally? More information about [idempotent requests](https://stripe.com/docs/api#idempotent_requests)
- Indicate that some posts' permalink will not change (if metadata) on the dashboard when setting the blog's permalink format. Tell Chet.
- Dumb quotes are still smartified, even without typeset enabled, possibly by pandoc?
- Undo option for form changes
- Add transactional emails notifying customer of changes to their email or password.
- When a customer pastes the whole tracking script into the preferences page on the dashboard, strip out everything except the ID which we need... perhaps create a page explaining what
is happening before doing this.
- Handle noscript on dashboard / signup gracefully (remove all dashboard js?)

Improvements to Git client
- Make it possible to connect github repo via their API and tell [reg](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzQXKhPKRfSsfGpXCdcxtFBhdKDt)
- Add support for LFS and tell [Jamie](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwBVMcpnxGHqnxJHNdbMBSrglzg)
- Remove git folder when switching to Dropbox client and tell [Jamie](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwGDDqlwPCNcJrLDqprtcKWXFTn)
- Backdate existing commits (perhaps set file ctime using info from git log?) This would sidestep the frustration experienced by [Gavin](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1669a8e621f9ef37) when he imported an existing repository.
- Fix bugs with git removed / renamed file unit test on Travis
- Extend sync lock during long syncs
- Write test to simulate process dying and restarting mid-pull. Does the client recover? What happens if a pull fails midway? Does git recover?
- Write tests for a series of random client operations (pull, add, push, move, reset, delete) that can be seeded and reliably re-run in the case of failure.
- Move to neat promise chain api when 2.0 comes out
* Test that client must keep sending new entries and deleted entries when it recieved an error from entry.build otherwise you get ghost posts...
- send nice error message with instructions for 413 request too large: "git reset HEAD^" etc...
- Thoroughly document:
- Tidy up tests and reduce size and runtime
- This client should acquire a lock on the blog's folder before doing stuff to it more generally, especially during initialization etc...
- what happens if customer changes their handle? will pushing break?
  - I want them to be able to keep using their old one *until* someone else claims it, then I want 401 unauthorized, please reauthenticate with new username... but the remote path will be wrong?
- Rate limit authentication route?

Dropbox client
- Handle file renames using Dropbox IDs to avoid the 'new entry' bug when you rename a file
- Build posts incrementally while big syncs are taking place 
- Revert lowercase for all files when disconnecting the client
- add support for Dropbox Paper files using paperDocsDownload and tell [Emad](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwHMZJvMswZZXKvLfBRBVqfzksw)
- Add integration test with a dropbox Webhook call. I want to not push some code which would prevent syncing customer folders.
- Does client.remove support the removal of folders? If not, make it so and add a test
- Add a step to authentication flow which says: 'there is already a folder called 'Your blog title' in your Dropbox, would you like to use that?' then overwrite the files inside. This prevents the proliferation of confusing 'Your blog title (1)' when you re-authenticate.
- Add a progress bar to the dashboard when writing existing files to Dropbox. It takes a while and confuses people.
- Adding an additional blog to existing app folder under constant webhooks failed. New blog had correct folder but old blog still used root. I guess we need to acquire a lock on ALL blogs interacting with that dropbox account.
- Extend sync lock during long syncs
- Write test to simulate process dying and restarting mid-pull. Does the client recover?
- Write tests for a series of random dropbox client operations (pull, add, push, move, reset, delete) that can be seeded and reliably re-run in the case of failure.
- Look into getAccessTokenFromCode on DBSDK repo to avoid the mess in get_account.js https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-js/issues/64
- Gracefuly retry wrapper around Dropbox
- Can we write to a folder_id instead of a path? It would be nice to be able to move the blog's folder even when writing the initial files to it, for example...
- This should be simple once we copy the exisiting state of the blog folder across. But right now it doesn't really do much. It resets the local server folder. Then resyncs.
- Update to latest version of Dropbox client.
- Make the folder in Dropbox rename automatically when the
customer changes the username for one of their multiple blogs?

Add media-query to prevent typeset hanging punctuation on small screens (it looks weird) and tell [Shibel](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwCgpXqMzwcBGWgjxgpcpCnMCQW)

Make Redis performance improvements
- Research [Redis clustering](http://highscalability.com/blog/2019/2/19/intro-to-redis-cluster-sharding-advantages-limitations-deplo.html)
- Prune redis keys and begin storing more on disk
- [redis analysis tool](https://github.com/snmaynard/redis-audit)
- Move to using unix socket with redis client per [documentation](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis) for better throughput. [Read this issue first](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis/issues/204), I might need to make some user group permissions tweaks to ensure things are secure.

Restructure application folder
- make serving static files from NGINX easier?
  - ln /data/blogs/{blogID}/folder /data/cache/{hostname}/folder/...
  - ln /data/blogs/{blogID}/static  /data/cache/{hostname}/static/...
- consolidating the data stored about each blog
- Specfic ideas:
  - Move cache directory from /cache to /data/cache
  - Move blog's folder contents from /blogs/{blogID} to data/blogs/{blogID}/folder
  - Move static files directory from /static/{blogID} to /data/blogs/{blogID}/static
  - Move db directory from /db to /data/db
  - Remove /tmp directory and instead use os.tmpDir

Switch to streaming JSON parser. There are npm modules that offer asynchronous JSON APIs. See for example:
- JSONStream, which has stream APIs.
- Big-Friendly JSON, which has stream APIs as well as asynchronous versions of the standard JSON APIs using the partitioning-on-the-Event-Loop paradigm outlined below.

Add notification emails for monit events

Could we have multiple syncing method attached to one blog?

Generate list of external API dependencies and follow changes for each

Subscription refactor
- Different payment methods per blog
- Seperate blog subscriptions behind the scenes to avoid the crazy calculations. Think of them like domains, you wouldn't do what Blot is doing for those...

Create script to export Blot sites to common formats like Wordpress and let Roberto know

Move to Linode?
- Preserve AWS elastic IP and proxy to Linode
- Think about eventual multiple locations around the world from day 1
- Work out the [pricing model carefully](https://www.linode.com/pricing)
- Use [blockstorage this for storing all customers' folders](https://www.linode.com/blockstorage)
- Use [backups](https://www.linode.com/backups)
- Use [nodebalancers](https://www.linode.com/nodebalancers)

Increase price to $5 per month for new customers. This will not affect existing customers in any way.

- Add a slack.com style dropdown on the public homepage for logged in customers which takes them to the dashboard for their sites.

When the customer's blog does not have a client, client.write and client.remove need to remove the files from the source folder. Create some kind of local client which we fall back and use when none is configured?

Work out how to host podcasts on Blot and tell [Adrian](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxvzLrCjsVpbQmLZmGvkrPbqWhZC)
