Begin collecting proper measurements for page-rendering speed on the server. This will help us identify ways to improve the speed of your site.

Resolve [issues with borked git client and tell V](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGkXwDNqDFKdWBQPTBpwQRzgsGd)

If using the git client, if building one entry fails, it seems that the rest of the entries in the same sync also fail?
- so right now build/metadata is used multiple times. in certain cases it is wrapped in a try/catch but in others it is not. we need to wrap it in try/catch wherever it is used
- right now, if build/main throws an uncaught exception, it seems like the rest of the sync fails. this needs to not happen
- to debug, add one invalid file ('foo: bar: baz\nxyz') and one valid file ('valid') and sync
- If there is a build error with a specific post, show it on the dashboard, e.g. on the file viewer
- Tell Johannes, Rizwan

Add raw-link -> embed function, which would fetch the title, description and thumbnail for a link using <meta> tags.

- Better more consistent documentation
- Improve template engine itself
- Improve source code for templates

Add action to lint code with jshint and eslint
  - any other static code analysis tools?
  - separate code to check for broken links, run in parallel
  
Add request level timeouts to prevent server swamping
- ensure to remove the timeout from the SSE streaming routes (drafts, sync status on dashboard)
- read this guide: http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/timeout.html
- it seems we also need to cancel the resources involved in responding to the request (i.e. disk io, db calls) for this to be really useful
- Add a timeout of 15 seconds for building posts.

Server changes
- Write useful benchmark tool for Blot
- Add memory monitor which notifies me when memory is mostly consumed
- Migrate to lower-cost r6gd.xlarge instance, which is not possible using the AWS console due to some difference in architecture (intel vs. amazon chip?). 
- Work out how to detect stray build processes. There were a bunch of zombies consuming memory on Blot's server. Work out how to kill them safely
- Experiment with different EBS types, perhaps try to use ephemeral disk more since lower latency?
- Take full advantage of attached SSD
  - use rsync/inotify to synchronize 'source of truth' EBS disk with the local SSD cache then modify NGINX to check the synced folder on the /cache disk
  - on boot we would gently copy across all /blogs folders and the /static directory in background task

Add [.rtf support](https://github.com/tbluemel/rtf.js)

Migrate from mailgun to SES, mailgun's javascript sdk [seems](https://github.com/mailgun/mailgun-js/issues/122) [like](https://github.com/mailgun/mailgun-js#setup-client) a mess.

Improvements to Wikilinks feature:
- test with non-[[Wikilinks]] options in Obsidian
- add support for other (non-Obsidian) wikilink styles (i.e. title-based?)

- look up the config in the the nearest `.obsidian` directory to determine whether shortest, relative or absolute wikilinks are in use?
- test with all Obsidian new link settings (shortest, relative and absolute)

Improvements to simple local server (npm run local):
- Consider using [redis-mock](https://github.com/yeahoffline/redis-mock) and [mockery](https://github.com/mfncooper/mockery)

Subdomains with numbers in them cause SSL certificate errors (e.g. foo2.blot.im)

The typeset settings do not actually affect anything (you can only disable/enable)

Template engine plan
- create data/blogs/blogID/templates directory
- show error message on preview-of subdomain
- only allow valid templates to get stored in data/blogs/blogID/templates, used for live site?
  - maybe we only store in redis valid templates, live site pulls

Fix bug with a once-scheduled post, based on the file's path or previous date metadata. The post remains scheduled even if the date is removed, and even if it is then rebuilt.

Add support for .tiff images

Resolve [issue](https://blot.im/questions/33) with Pandoc and footnotes and aria and role attributes. Can this be fixed simply by updating pandoc or do we need to prune these attributes ourselves?

Improve server-side scheduled tasks:
- Write task to identify and delete long overdue users
- Back up postgres database

Fetch dimensions of images even if optimize and cache is disable, so that image zoom can work. Tell [Joshua](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwLsmhMtGvPcwxlSHSSTFVpJVbd)

- Fix bug with "Menu: " metadata – that empty value example will cause a post to become a page.
- Fix summary generator such that a subtitle is used for summary text (i.e. an h2 directly following an h1) We still want to prevent the scenario in which a later h2 becomes the summary, though. Notify [Jessica and rebuild Jessica's site](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/KtbxLwghhxtxrtdGHFqBRMcDGkGWtxvSdq)

Reduce image compression settings and tell [Joshua](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwLsmhMtGvPcwxlSHSSTFVpJVbd)

Improve questions section of site, in approximate order of importance:

  - add option to hide/delete a question
  - question tagging, including a list of all tags, and popular tags
  - give the 'ask' and 'answer' textarea inputs the full functionality of the GitHub issue/PR comment inputs (i.e. code snippets / preview / copy/paste screenshots from clipboard)
  - email notifications (There's an existing system in place for sending emails in app/helper/email)  
  - upvoting for topics and upvote-based ranking on the topic index
  - show vote count and answer count next to each question on index
  - add a filter for topic index to show questions by: 'Newest', 'Active', 'Unanswered', 'Votes'
  - 'run code snippet' feature / similar to trinkets.io

Consider adding support for nested page structure
- generate nested menu items from nested folders in /pages

Add support for .doc using [libreoffice](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libreoffice-convert) and tell [Kyle](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwKkHZVgwCNwsdlhdzCggRtsRhN)

Consider adding 'default metadata' option to dashboard
- Tell [Mike](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwLscxQPSzQtKbhpHpJgbNlgCQZ)

Redirect URLs with trailing slash when possible (i.e. not directory browsing) to [fix possible duplicate content penalties](https://moz.com/community/q/duplicate-content-with-a-trailing-slash) and tell [Marius](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwKkHhPFPKFBzQjQQHwlrRWwbKq)
- Add rel=canonical to all the default templates, or fix the issue that Blot serves the same thing to URLs with a trailing slash, and without. 
- If we do add rel=canonical, make sure to consider the situation where someone mounts a page to the index of their site, e.g. /page/1 and / will now be different.

Add way to nest tags / hierarchy for tags and tell [Uzoamaka](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwLsJwTqFWjRgHLhPXJgBtnGwJJ)

Investigate potentially TeX-related escaping issues and tell [Anthony](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwJWhzZspbBhTCPBGjvnslgrZlb) and Roy

Adjust the chargeForRemaining function in create-blog such that the balance is added or deducted from the proration charge.

Rewrite transformer
- Speak HTTP properly, respect backoffs, use/send eTags
- Share information across blogs?
- Improve transformer so it checks a file's MTIME against a stored value before rehashing the file?
- Adjust interface to accept a number of directories. Make it 'unaware' of blog IDs?
- Add method which accepts a path or URL and flushes what is stored for it, update the rebuild entry script
- Cache errors. When a post contains multiple identical links to images that timeout/404, the thumbnail generator should only make 1 attempt to fetch them. Right now we have a post that is filled with identical broken image links (in this case to a spacer.gif) can suck up the build process for hours. 

Add a 'page link format' option to the dashboard – the link format now only applies to entries. Tell [Mike](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwKkbjLjgTZLQqMFFMzBBpzMZTg)

Generate proper favicons from uploaded avatars (to prevent streched favicons when non-square avatars are uploaded)

Experiment with GitHub actions setup
- Look into potentially useful actions for code quality / linting / automtatic dependency updates
  - [super-linter](https://github.com/github/super-linter#how-it-works)?

Improvements to server infrastructure
- Work out way to recover from expired cert in the cache. To reproduce, consider a member who signed up, connected example.com, then moved the domain to another service. The attempt to renew the cert for example.com will fail. When the user re-registers with Blot, for some reason open-resty-auto-ssl will serve an old certificate. I followed these steps to [reset](https://github.com/GUI/lua-resty-auto-ssl/issues/42) but we should automate this
- Create DMARC record for Blot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/dmarc.html
- NGINX doesn't appear to be following the symlinks created by node.js to serve the contents of each blog's folder and the contents of each blog's static directory. Is this a permissions issue? Is now finally the time to set up users with appropriate permissions for blot, nginx, build etc...

Improve the automatic title generated for screenshots with default MacOs filename from 'at 14:40pm'

Add support for posts generated from Excel files, would generate a table. Use [this library](https://github.com/joshboyan/excel-to-html-table)?

Improvements to backup system
- Add hourly local redis rdb dumps to /cache
- Test maintenance mode
- Add script to roll back into hourly local db dumps and remote backups

Add status page information to news page:
- customize the design of this page a little (could we self-host on a different service, e.g. linode, a page which makes an API call to updown?)
- embed a brief status history in the brochure site somewhere
- link to this status page in the 502 bad gateway error page

Improvements to template editor
- Add layout options to template editor for native templates
- Work out how to make live but saveable modifications for preview purposes on the template editor. I have already established a messaging channel between preview HTML pages and the template editor with the script injected in render/middleware.
- Add [background patterns](https://bansal.io/pattern-css#checks) to template editor tools, tell [Ish](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwHMsVFZBwLtkGslXZXkcxmKdvf)

Work out how to cache 404s at the NGINX level
- I tried extending express-disk-cache to store images inside /https/blot.im/missing/foo-bar.html but I can't set a 404 status code for the specific tryfiles directive which could match that file.
- The application server ends up spending a lot of time serving 404s

Improvements to template engine
- Make date-format settings template specific and tell [Mike](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwGDWqXmTLfljkKdGlfFMhMdkTm) "I forked the Archive template but did *not* install it. And yet, changing settings like "Hide the publish date for your posts" affected the currently installed template.""
- Add 'group by' function which would allow you to group posts by month/ year in the same way that {{#archives}} lets you and tell [Jay](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwLtGkSQnQDJRMcxKZhgQfbXvSF)
- Local editing

Improvements to developer guide
- Tell [Pedro](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwHMsSvqTVCjSSjJKVrGKmgRbjw)
- Add a simple 'Beginners guide' to HTML and CSS, which would rely on Blot's functionality as a static file server.


Improvements to entry builder
- Adjust title metadata extractor to fallback to file name rather than first sentence of file if the post does not contain a title tag. The current behaviour has suprised a number of people.

Tell [Jamie](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwChSCwMxNdtdvMHnMVwTcHPjfg) about the decision.

Improvements to Git client
- Add support for LFS and tell [Jamie](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwBVMcpnxGHqnxJHNdbMBSrglzg)
- Remove git folder when switching to Dropbox client and tell [Jamie](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwGDDqlwPCNcJrLDqprtcKWXFTn)
- Backdate existing commits (perhaps set file ctime using info from git log?) This would sidestep the frustration experienced by [Gavin](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1669a8e621f9ef37) when he imported an existing repository.
- Fix bugs with git removed / renamed file unit test on Travis
- Extend sync lock during long syncs
- Write test to simulate process dying and restarting mid-pull. Does the client recover? What happens if a pull fails midway? Does git recover?
- Write tests for a series of random client operations (pull, add, push, move, reset, delete) that can be seeded and reliably re-run in the case of failure.
- Move to neat promise chain api when 2.0 comes out
* Test that client must keep sending new entries and deleted entries when it recieved an error from entry.build otherwise you get ghost posts...
- send nice error message with instructions for 413 request too large: "git reset HEAD^" etc...
- Thoroughly document:
- Tidy up tests and reduce size and runtime
- This client should acquire a lock on the blog's folder before doing stuff to it more generally, especially during initialization etc...
- what happens if user changes their handle? will pushing break?
  - I want them to be able to keep using their old one *until* someone else claims it, then I want 401 unauthorized, please reauthenticate with new username... but the remote path will be wrong?
- Rate limit authentication route?

Dropbox client
- Add integration test with a dropbox Webhook call. I want to not push some code which would prevent syncing user folders.
- Does client.remove support the removal of folders? If not, make it so and add a test
- Add a step to authentication flow which says: 'there is already a folder called 'Your blog title' in your Dropbox, would you like to use that?' then overwrite the files inside. This prevents the proliferation of confusing 'Your blog title (1)' when you re-authenticate.
- Add a progress bar to the dashboard when writing existing files to Dropbox. It takes a while and confuses people.
- Adding an additional blog to existing app folder under constant webhooks failed. New blog had correct folder but old blog still used root. I guess we need to acquire a lock on ALL blogs interacting with that dropbox account.
- Extend sync lock during long syncs
- Write test to simulate process dying and restarting mid-pull. Does the client recover?
- Write tests for a series of random dropbox client operations (pull, add, push, move, reset, delete) that can be seeded and reliably re-run in the case of failure.
- Look into getAccessTokenFromCode on DBSDK repo to avoid the mess in get_account.js https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-js/issues/64
- Gracefuly retry wrapper around Dropbox
- Can we write to a folder_id instead of a path? It would be nice to be able to move the blog's folder even when writing the initial files to it, for example...
- This should be simple once we copy the exisiting state of the blog folder across. But right now it doesn't really do much. It resets the local server folder. Then resyncs.
- Update to latest version of Dropbox client.
- Make the folder in Dropbox rename automatically when the
user changes the username for one of their multiple blogs?

Add media-query to prevent typeset hanging punctuation on small screens (it looks weird) and tell [Shibel](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwCgpXqMzwcBGWgjxgpcpCnMCQW)

Make Redis performance improvements
- Research [Redis clustering](http://highscalability.com/blog/2019/2/19/intro-to-redis-cluster-sharding-advantages-limitations-deplo.html)
- Prune redis keys and begin storing more on disk
- [redis analysis tool](https://github.com/snmaynard/redis-audit)
- Move to using unix socket with redis client per [documentation](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis) for better throughput. [Read this issue first](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis/issues/204), I might need to make some user group permissions tweaks to ensure things are secure.

Restructure application folder
- make serving static files from NGINX easier?
  - ln /data/blogs/{blogID}/folder /data/cache/{hostname}/folder/...
  - ln /data/blogs/{blogID}/static  /data/cache/{hostname}/static/...
- consolidating the data stored about each blog
- Specfic ideas:
  - Move cache directory from /cache to /data/cache
  - Move blog's folder contents from /blogs/{blogID} to data/blogs/{blogID}/folder
  - Move static files directory from /static/{blogID} to /data/blogs/{blogID}/static
  - Move db directory from /db to /data/db
  - Move logs directory from /logs to /data/logs
  - Remove /tmp directory and instead use os.tmpDir

Fix bug with .emf files in Word Document and follow up with Todd. Can we convert EMFs? Can we pass a flag to pandoc to let them deal with it? Is this just caused by Tiff files? I need a Windows machine to test this.

Could we have multiple clients attached to one blog?

Use the [--trace-sync-io command-line flag](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html#set-node_env-to-production) to determine if Blot is using any sync methods inappropriately

Make sure [color schemes have enough contrast](https://stripe.com/blog/accessible-color-systems)

Subscription refactor
- Different payment methods per blog
- Seperate blog subscriptions behind the scenes to avoid the crazy calculations. Think of them like domains, you wouldn't do what Blot is doing for those...

Add nice import step under 'Services' and as part of sign up
- Create importer script for [John's posts from flickr](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/166da622325d19e7)

Create script to export Blot sites to common formats like Wordpress and let Roberto know

Move to Linode?
- Preserve AWS elastic IP and proxy to Linode
- Think about eventual multiple locations around the world from day 1
- Work out the [pricing model carefully](https://www.linode.com/pricing)
- Use [blockstorage this for storing all users' folders](https://www.linode.com/blockstorage)
- Use [backups](https://www.linode.com/backups)
- Use [nodebalancers](https://www.linode.com/nodebalancers)
