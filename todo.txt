- Add support for fetching only some properties of an entry (ideally only those that are used). prevent some properties from being fetched in some lists (html, for example in all_entries). Would be a good candidate for hgetall or hget?

Dashboard
- Add a broken link checker
- Dumb quotes are still smartified, even without typeset enabled, possibly by pandoc?
- Tolerate missing 'www' in personal domain field on dashboard for users with a custom domain when checking validity
- Undo option for form changes
- Add transactional emails notifying user of changes to their email or password.
- Implement a flags page for toggling all the settings (including hidden ones) for a given blog
- Route requests to new dashboard if toggle is on to allow thorough testing
- When a user pastes the whole tracking script into the preferences page on the dashboard,
strip out everything except the ID which we need... perhaps create a page explaining what
is happening before doing this.
- Handle noscript on dashboard / signup gracefully (remove all dashboard js?)
- Allow users who are restarting an account with multiple blogs to disable some before restarting.
- Take a look at Notion and Cargo for some neat ideas

Public site
- Log 404s on the public site to identify neccessary redirects
- Personalize the documentation for logged in users

Add support for native PDF embeds in posts, just put a link to a PDF or a path, e.g. /_assets/file.pdf --> would become a nice embed.

Add support for native MP3 embeds in posts, just put a link to an MP3 or a path, e.g. /_assets/file.mp3 --> would become a nice embed then tell [Luke](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwBVWLlqqwbksXcScNdhcTjhjfq) and [Nash](twitter.com/nashp)

- Multi-file posts with the same name but different extension (image.txt and image.jpg)
- Markdown
  Write a pandoc compatible markdown converter in javascript
  to resolve some of the performance issues with pandoc. Perhaps just use [Markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)

Allow Blot to fallback to client.read if the file does not exist on the blot server. Say the harddrive is wiped, we still would like to serve blog files

Sync
- Re-implement folder verification feature and make use of the local content hash computation script to verify we have the correct version of a given file
- Make the sync / rebuild proceses run with unpriviledged user permissions to ensure shit isnt fucked with user input...
– Re-instate feature to check if a rogue sync took down the server and run sync on a seperate process
- Add method to pause syncing and prevent future syncs
then use this method with the create/remove blog migration too.
- Ensure sync script is run by less priveledged user (just access to /tmp ? /blogs/{{ID}})?

Buy the .com
- Remember to bump LetsEncrypt rate limits if needed
- Remember to transfer Dropbox webhooks to new domain on the Dropbox developers console

Incorporate

Add support for other payment methods
- Bitcoin and tell [Chaz](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#sent/165b726aa900158a)
- Paypal

Support embedding an image in a post by copy-pasting the Dropbox share link
- Let [Logan](https://twitter.com/blot__/status/962762284782243842) know

Increase price for new customers to $60 a year. This will not affect existing customers.

---

Git client:
- Add support for LFS and tell [Jamie](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwBVMcpnxGHqnxJHNdbMBSrglzg)
- Backdate existing commits (perhaps set file ctime using info from git log?) This would sidestep the frustration experienced by [Gavin](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1669a8e621f9ef37) when he imported an existing repository.
- Extend sync lock during long syncs
- Write test to simulate process dying and restarting mid-pull. Does the client recover? What happens if a pull fails midway? Does git recover?
- Write tests for a series of random client operations (pull, add, push, move, reset, delete) that can be seeded and reliably re-run in the case of failure.
- Move to neat promise chain api when 2.0 comes out
* Test that client must keep sending new entries and deleted entries when it recieved an error from entry.build otherwise you get ghost posts...
- send nice error message with instructions for 413 request too large: "git reset HEAD^" etc...
- Thoroughly document:
- Tidy up tests and reduce size and runtime
- This client should acquire a lock on the blog's folder before doing stuff to it more generally, especially during initialization etc...
- what happens if user changes their handle? will pushing break?
  - I want them to be able to keep using their old one *until* someone else claims it, then I want 401 unauthorized, please reauthenticate with new username... but the remote path will be wrong?
- Rate limit authentication route?

Review [Fathom analytics](https://usefathom.com/) and get back to [Marcus](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwBWKVZBFfnxCDXcmCzMXDHcTDv)

Dropbox client:
- Add integration test with a dropbox Webhook call. I want to not push some code which would prevent syncing user folders.
- Does client.remove support the removal of folders? If not, make it so and add a test
- Add a step to authentication flow which says: 'there is already a folder called 'Your blog title' in your Dropbox, would you like to use that?' then overwrite the files inside. This prevents the proliferation of confusing 'Your blog title (1)' when you re-authenticate.
- Add a progress bar to the dashboard when writing existing files to Dropbox. It takes a while and confuses people.
- Adding an additional blog to existing app folder under constant webhooks failed. New blog had correct folder but old blog still used root. I guess we need to acquire a lock on ALL blogs interacting with that dropbox account.
- Extend sync lock during long syncs
- Write test to simulate process dying and restarting mid-pull. Does the client recover?
- Write tests for a series of random dropbox client operations (pull, add, push, move, reset, delete) that can be seeded and reliably re-run in the case of failure.
- Look into getAccessTokenFromCode on DBSDK repo to avoid the mess in get_account.js https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-js/issues/64
- Gracefuly retry wrapper around Dropbox
- Can we write to a folder_id instead of a path? It would be nice to be able to move the blog's folder even when writing the initial files to it, for example...
- This should be simple once we copy the exisiting state of the blog folder across. But right now it doesn't really do much. It resets the local server folder. Then resyncs.
- Update to latest version of Dropbox client.
- Make the folder in Dropbox rename automatically when the
user changes the username for one of their multiple blogs?

Consider supporting Open Graph
- Tell [Luke](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/163993b0f8499ab3)

NGINX
- Improve error pages
- Recompile nginx with neccessary dependencies for auto-ssl instead of openresty?
- Install nginx fail2ban & http2

Support linking to another blog post by its *file path*
- This would help with the importer to fix broken links
- See [how Pelican does it](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/content.html#linking-to-internal-content)

Removing Date metadata from a post should reset its date to the file's creation date
- Currently nothing changes.

Add a file dependency / dependents list to each entry then use this to rebuild dependent entries when, for example, a public image is updated.

Add support for comments via webmentions like Disqus and tell Amit

Investigate [commento](https://commento.io/) as an alternative to Disqus

Automate setting up application environment using /etc/profile.d:

  sudo echo "export BLOT_CACHE=true" > /etc/profile.d/blot.sh
  sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/blot.sh

Move away from upstart to systemd, because there was an issue with upstart losing track of nginx and failing to stop or restart its process.



Thumbnail generator
- Improve transformer so it checks a file's MTIME against a stored value before rehashing the file
- Generate thumbnails for GIFs / SVG thum
- Prioritize faces
- Aim to generate distinct thumbnails across the blog
- Try to crop out ruined borders. E.g. when making a square crop of a rectangular image with a border, crop into the image as well to remove the border-on-three-sides effect
- Extract color palette too for the image
- Run quickly first time, then run in the background to pick the best thumbnail
- Offer imgix style API for embedding thumbnails
