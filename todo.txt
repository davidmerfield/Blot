- Ask to confirm, but remove files from blog folder when disabling local editing
- Move to uuid based template IDs instead of slug  
- Add support for 'creating' a template inside '/Templates/'
- Add export to zip and import to zip feature for themes
- Fix bug with theme editor which prevents you from setting the route of a new view. You need to set it, then reset it for the route to work as expected.

- Fix bug with cache not busting for static rendered themes:
  1. put posts in blog
  2. sync, create view e.g. static.js which renders all_entries
  3. remove posts from blog
  4. reload page, static.js still shows the entries, which archives.html does not

This should also fix bug with case-sensitive paths to thumbnails + Dropbox client and tell Jan-Erik on Twitter DMs. Make resolve work more impressively, attempt to resolve a path in a case insensitive manner.

Move to using unix socket with redis client per [documentation](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis) for better throughput. [Read this issue first](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis/issues/204), I might need to make some user group permissions tweaks to ensure things are secure.

Seperate blog subscriptions behind the scenes to avoid the crazy calculations. Think of them like domains, you wouldn't do what Blot is doing for those...

Increase default quality for sharp's output images

Client.write does not propogate sync errors... to demonstrate this, revoke dropbox token then try to enable local editing.

Re-enable image minifier and fix the bugs it creates
  
Can we keep the pandoc child_process running and pipe stuff in and out for speed? Measure before after to ensure this helps

- Use [blockstorage this for storing all users' folders](https://www.linode.com/blockstorage)
- Use [backups](https://www.linode.com/backups)
- Use [nodebalancers](https://www.linode.com/nodebalancers)

Prune package.json
- To [minify HTML](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier)
- To [minify CSS](https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano) [(alternative)](https://github.com/css/csso)
- To [minify JavaScript](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) [(alternative)](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/)

Cluster the main process. How will I verify that there is not statefullness somewhere in the server? I also want the main 'server' running on different threads to the CPU intensive stuff like image processing. Will this fix the bug with additional child processes if main process runs out of memory? Something wasn't being killed during the Nash WAV bug of August, 2018. There were duplicate node rebuild processes running.

Move to cool user subdomains
 - Pretty to proper blog IDs instead of integers

Public site
- Log 404s on the public site to identify neccessary redirects
- Personalize the documentation for logged in users
- Add a resource page to the documentation with guides like [Chad's](https://twitter.com/chad_g_moore/status/975104556001583104?s=20)
  And useful text editors like [this one recommended by Andrew](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/write-best-note-taking-app/id848311469)
- Inline all CSS for performance
- Render the formatting guide navigation on the server

Developer documentation
  - Make reference page searchable
  - Add types and examples to items on reference page
  - Work how to explain the archives property

Self-hosting documentation then tell [Jake](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/1659d67326849fb3) and [Mohammed](https://twitter.com/mnafees_me/status/1051121206030753794?s=12)

Investigate static site search offerings
- It would be nice to have one whose index you could build on 
  the server, and deliver statically, perhaps even chunked if it was huge
- Would be nice to be able to patch updates to this index quickly without
  rebuilding the whole thing

Template
- Add support for 'Template' folder and a way to copy this to dashboard?

- How do we share info, like a link on a menu, or a header image across themes? Could there be a shared info repository that themes could access?

- add support for dynamic partials to make collections possible, e.g. {{> /{tag}.html}} ?

- Add neat interface to customize blog level variables?

- How do we transition from a global menu to one that the themes have control over? How do we share existing links between themes? How do we deal with the order of pages in a user's folder?

- How do we transition from a global date display format to one that themes have control over?

- Change url?json=true to debug=true?

- Port the jekyll theme [Neocactus](https://github.com/mmarfil/neocactus/) to Blot and document the process
  then tell [Robert](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/16288ce117d980e4)

- Finish Ghost theme import for [Kingi](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/1625fdd572e72c69)
- Draw simple abstract representations of each theme for the themes page to replace thumbnails
- Install and test a few of these [static site generators](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17942395)

- Consider making file-based theme directory a git repo and using this to implement basic undo-redo functionality. 
- Disable re-rendering for locals
- Add better customization options
- Local theme editing does not clear cache
- Use Hogan for precompiling and rendering themes?
- Parse tokens and params from routes and tell [Jason](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/163186d43aaf52af)
- Add way to allow all entry lists to access {{#months}} sorting options just like the archives page.
- Fix [Frank](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/1527fbcf999ba0c3)'s strange theme bug
- Warn users that underscore will not work for hidden pages
- Fix _ entries to true public files, tell john & other folks who depend on the menu: yes, page: no side effect
- Tell [Rodrigo](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1564a13991197f63) don't write previews for _ posts
- Add support for fetching only some properties of an entry (ideally only those that are used). prevent some properties from being fetched in some lists (html, for example in all_entries). Would be a good candidate for hgetall or hget?


Dashboard
- Offering a broken link checker service
- Dumb quotes are still smartified, even without typeset enabled.
- Tolerate missing 'www' in personal domain field on dashboard for users with a custom domain when checking validity
- Can we trim the homepage to get to this? Title , Domain, Theme , Photo , URLs  , Dates.
  Menu, Dates, Disqus, Analytics etc. would be customized per theme
  Services page would be phased out, perhaps introducing metadata flags, e.g.
     Typeset: no
     Katex: no
  Or global flags in something like config.json. Would be rare though.
  Client would be a link at the bottom corner of the folder. Synced by Dropbox (edit)

- Generate SSL cert for www subdomain of apex domain pointed to Blot, and redirect it to apex domain. Tell [Paul](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/164423db2ef130b0)

- Implement a flags page for toggling all the settings (including hidden ones) for a given blog
- Route requests to new dashboard if toggle is on to allow thorough testing
- When a user pastes the whole tracking script into the preferences page on the dashboard,
strip out everything except the ID which we need... perhaps create a page explaining what
is happening before doing this.
- Handle noscript on dashboard / signup gracefully (remove all dashboard js?)
- Allow users who are restarting an account with multiple blogs to disable some before restarting.
- Take a look at Notion and Cargo for some neat ideas
- Disabling a blog should free up the domain and handle associated
- Removing a domain from a blog does NOT delete the domain:example.com key from redis. meaning if a user sets a domain once, it's effectively theirs forever. This is a bug!

File converters / codecs
- Video posts (.mp4)
- OPML files and tell [John](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/1659bac084c3e404)

  Tell Jonathan: https://twitter.com/chin_jon/status/1032392398473650176

Allow Blot to fallback to client.read if the file does not exist on the blot server. Say the harddrive is wiped, we still would like to serve blog files

Sync
- Re-implement folder verification feature and make use of the local content hash computation script to verify we have the correct version of a given file
- Make the sync / rebuild proceses run with unpriviledged user permissions to ensure shit isnt fucked with user input...
– Re-instate feature to check if a rogue sync took down the server and run sync on a seperate process
- Add method to pause syncing and prevent future syncs
then use this method with the create/remove blog migration too.
- Ensure sync script is run by less priveledged user (just access to /tmp ? /blogs/{{ID}})?

Increase price for new customers to $40 a year. This will not affect existing customers.

Increase price for new customers to $60 a year. This will not affect existing customers.

Git client:
- Backdate existing commits (perhaps set file ctime using info from git log?) This would sidestep the frustration experienced by [Gavin](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1669a8e621f9ef37) when he imported an existing repository.
- Extend sync lock during long syncs
- Write test to simulate process dying and restarting mid-pull. Does the client recover? What happens if a pull fails midway? Does git recover?
- Write tests for a series of random client operations (pull, add, push, move, reset, delete) that can be seeded and reliably re-run in the case of failure.
- Move to neat promise chain api when 2.0 comes out
* Test that client must keep sending new entries and deleted entries when it recieved an error from entry.build otherwise you get ghost posts...
- send nice error message with instructions for 413 request too large: "git reset HEAD^" etc...
- Thoroughly document:
  - write
- - read
  - sync
- Tidy up tests and reduce size and runtime
- Add documentation and an explanation for how to mirror blot blog repo on Github or Gitlab:
  https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/1658e28be94479af
- This client should acquire a lock on the blog's folder before doing stuff to it more generally, especially during initialization etc...
- what happens if user changes their handle? will pushing break?
  - I want them to be able to keep using their old one *until* someone else claims it, then I want 401 unauthorized, please reauthenticate with new username... but the remote path will be wrong?
- Rate limit authentication route?

Dropbox client:
- Adding an additional blog to existing app folder under constant webhooks failed. New blog had correct folder but old blog still used root. I guess we need to acquire a lock on ALL blogs interacting with that dropbox account.
- Extend sync lock during long syncs
- Write test to simulate process dying and restarting mid-pull. Does the client recover? 
- Write tests for a series of random dropbox client operations (pull, add, push, move, reset, delete) that can be seeded and reliably re-run in the case of failure.
- Look into getAccessTokenFromCode on DBSDK repo to avoid the mess in get_account.js https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-js/issues/64
- Gracefuly retry wrapper around Dropbox
- Can we write to a folder_id instead of a path? It would be nice to be able to move the blog's folder even when writing the initial files to it, for example...
- This should be simple once we copy the exisiting state of the blog folder across. But right now it doesn't really do much. It resets the local server folder. Then resyncs.
- Update to latest version of Dropbox client.
- Make the folder in Dropbox rename automatically when the
user changes the username for one of their multiple blogs?

NGINX
- Improve error pages

- Install nginx fail2ban & http2

Support linking to another blog post by its *file path*
- This would help with the importer to fix broken links
- See [how Pelican does it](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/content.html#linking-to-internal-content)

Generative tree
- Add a generative tree illustration to account page that is 'seeded' when you sign up and grows as you keep your account open. Slowly, day by day. Would still be growing in 1000 years should your account stay open that long.
- Learn about old trees
- Learn how to make a generative illustration and render it quickly on the server
- I like this idea because it's sort of anti-Farmville (i.e. click-to-grow, engage-to-grow). The tree just grows. No badgering to post more to keep the tree alive, all you have to do is keep your account. When you delete your account you just see the tree, and a thank you. Obviously don't do anything tacky like cut the tree down or anything. That would be horrible.
- Could this [Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) algorithm be useful? 
- Look into [computational biology and fractals](https://www.google.com/search?q=computational+biology+fractals+book&hl=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1xbbFqtTeAhUJ21MKHUEsD2oQ_AUIEygB&biw=1440&bih=821#imgrc=_)

Removing Date metadata from a post should reset its date to the file's creation date
- Currently nothing changes.

- Would append to any other date associated with the post.

Thumbnail generator
- Improve transformer so it checks a file's MTIME against a stored value before rehashing the file
- Generate thumbnails for GIFs / SVG thum
- Prioritize faces
- Aim to generate distinct thumbnails across the blog
- Try to crop out ruined borders. E.g. when making a square crop of a rectangular image with a border, crop into the image as well to remove the border-on-three-sides effect
- Extract color palette too for the image
- Run quickly first time, then run in the background to pick the best thumbnail
- Offer imgix style API for embedding thumbnails
