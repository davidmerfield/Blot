Blot is a site generator. Blot turns a folder into a website. The point of all this — the reason Blot exists — is so you can use your favorite tools to create whatever you publish. Please don’t hesitate to contact me with any questions:

The general architecture of Blot is:

The internet <> Reverse proxy (Openresty) <> Blot (express.js node application) <> Redis

To get Blot running locally, you will need Docker. Once you have Docker installed and running, clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/davidmerfield/blot --depth 1

Create an empty `.env` file which you can use to further configure Blot with environment variables.

touch .env

Then start the server:

npm start

Before you begin working on the code, you'll need to open up the following URLs in your browser and add an exception for the self-signed SSL certificates which we've generated:

https://localhost/ - The dashboard
https://cdn.localhost/ - The CDN
https://example.localhost/ - Your site

You can edit the folder for the example blog inside the `data` directory:

./data/blogs/blog_$ID
