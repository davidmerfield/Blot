Re-authentication required with your git client

I’m writing because one of your blogs hosted by [Blot](https://blot.im) uses git. I recently changed the way this client authenticates: instead of your blog’s username, the client uses your account’s email address. This change was neccessary to fix a bug for people who manage multiple blogs with git.

When you next push, your existing credentials will fail. Please use these credentials instead:

Username: {{email}}

Password: [View your git password](https://blot.im/settings/client/git)

If you have any questions, please reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
