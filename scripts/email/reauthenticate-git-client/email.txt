Re-authentication required for your blog{{s}} using git

I have changed the way [Blot’s git client](https://blot.im/clients/git) authenticates: instead of your blog’s username, the client now uses your account’s email address. This change was neccessary to fix a bug for people who manage multiple blogs with git.

When you next push, your existing credentials will fail. Please use these credentials instead:

Username: {{email}}

Password: [View the password{{s}} for your blog{{s}}](https://blot.im/log-in?then=/settings/client/git)

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
