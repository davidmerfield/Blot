# NOW IT SEEMS EC2-user can own the nginx log file?
# What is going on? I ran ./scripts/production/nginx_ as ec2-user
# and it worked and it seemed like the logfile is now owned by ec2-user?

# ------------------

# Why rotate log files?
# Otherwise we run out of disk space fairly quickly.

# Why not use an existing tool like logrotate?
# It seemed annoying to configure for multiple users.

# What issues did you have writing this script?
# The first is that we have log files owned by different
# users. For example, nginx's logfile is owned by root. All
# other logfiles are owned by ec2-user.

# The second is that files must be edited in-place, otherwise
# the process that logs to it loses track of the file.

# To install to script to run once per day at midnight as root:
# $ sudo crontab -e
# 0 0 * * * /var/www/blot/scripts/log-rotate.sh
# 0 1 * * * find /tmp -mtime +1 -delete

# To install to script to run once per day at midnight as ec2-user:
# sudo crontab -u ec2-user -e
# 0 0 * * * /var/www/blot/scripts/log-rotate.sh
# 0 1 * * * find /tmp -mtime +1 -delete

# Exit this script upon error
