# Guide for Setting Up and Running Your Application with PM2

### Step 1: Create an `.env` File

Create a `.env` file to store your environment variables:

    REMOTE_SERVER=https://localhost/clients/icloud
    ICLOUD_DRIVE_DIRECTORY=
    BLOT_ICLOUD_SERVER_SECRET=
    NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0

---

### Step 2: Setup

#### 1. Install Node.js

Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from the website

#### 2. Install PM2
Install PM2 globally using npm:

    npm install -g pm2

---

### Step 3: Start Your Application

Run your `index.js` application with PM2:

    pm2 start index.js --name macserver

This will start your application and name the process `macserver` for easier management.

#### Ensure the Application Restarts Automatically on Reboot

First, make sure the Mac automatically logs in on boot, rather than loading the login screen. You can configure this in **System Settings → Users & Groups → Login Options → Automatic Login**.

Run the following command in the **GUI session** (e.g., via VNC or physical login) to configure PM2 to start on boot:

    pm2 startup

Copy and run the command provided by PM2 (it will include `sudo` and some environment setup specific to your system). This sets up PM2 as a startup service specifically for the GUI session.

Save the current PM2 process list so it persists across reboots:

    pm2 save

After completing this setup, PM2 will start automatically when the GUI session is ready. You can still observe and manage the GUI-based PM2 processes via SSH.

**Notes for Managing PM2 via SSH**:

PM2 running in the GUI session can also be managed from an SSH connection. Log in via SSH and use the following commands to interact with your PM2 processes:

- View running processes:
  
      pm2 list

- Restart a process:
  
      pm2 restart macserver

- View logs:
  
      pm2 logs macserver

This ensures the application relies on GUI functionality and starts properly after a reboot, while remaining manageable remotely.

---

### Step 4: Deploy New Code

When you deploy new code, follow these steps:

#### 1. Pull the Changes
Run the following to fetch the latest changes from your Git repository:

    git pull

#### 2. Restart the Application in PM2
After pulling the changes, restart your application using PM2:

    pm2 restart macserver

---

### Step 5: Monitor Logs

To view the logs (`stdout` and `stderr`) for your application, run:

    pm2 logs macserver

You can also use:

    pm2 monit

This provides an interactive dashboard that shows CPU, memory usage, and logs for each process.
