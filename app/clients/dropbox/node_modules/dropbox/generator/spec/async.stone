namespace async

#
# Types for writing asynchronous API methods.
#
# There are two calls for each asynchronous method:
#  1. A "Launch" method that (optionally) launches the asynchronous job
#  2. A "Polling" method that polls for the status of the job that was launched by the first call.
#
# The following definitions are prefixed by "Launch" or "Poll", according to their intended use.

# Launch

union_closed LaunchResultBase
    "Result returned by methods that launch an asynchronous job.

    A method who may either launch an asynchronous job, or complete the request
    synchronously, can use this union by extending it, and adding a 'complete' field
    with the type of the synchronous response.

    See :type:`LaunchEmptyResult` for an example."

    async_job_id AsyncJobId
        "This response indicates that the processing is asynchronous.
        The string is an id that can be used to obtain the status of the asynchronous job."

    "Result returned by methods that may either launch an asynchronous job or complete synchronously.
    Upon synchronous completion of the job, no additional information is returned."

    example complete

    async_job_id AsyncJobId

        verify that the action you were taking succeeded, and if not, try
        again. This should happen very rarely."
