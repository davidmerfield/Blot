        Some cursors might be short-lived some cursors might be long-lived.

        This really depends on the sorting type and order, e.g.:

        1. on one hand, listing docs created by the user, sorted by the created time
        ascending will have undefinite expiration because the results cannot change while
        the iteration is happening. This cursor would be suitable for long term polling.

        2. on the other hand, listing docs sorted by the last modified time will have
        a very short expiration as docs do get modified very often and the modified time
        can be changed while the iteration is happening thus altering the results.
