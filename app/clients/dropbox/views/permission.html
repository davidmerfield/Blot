{{^full_access}}
    <p>You have granted <b>App folder</b> access to Blot for <b>{{blog.title}}</b>. This means Blot can only access a single folder in your Dropbox. If you grant <b>full folder access</b> to Blot, you will be freed of two restrictions that Dropbox places on App folders:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>You will be able to move your blog’s folder.</li>
  <li>You will be able to share your blog’s folder with other people who use Dropbox.</li> 
  </ul>
  <p>If you grant <b>full folder access</b> to Blot, I promise only to access the folder for <b>{{blog.title}}</b>. However, the tokens that Dropbox gives to Blot could be used to view or modify every file and folder in your Dropbox. Please consider the consequences of a hypothetical security breach carefully.</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Move <b>{{blog.title}}</b>'s folder </li>
  <li>Share <b>{{blog.title}}</b>'s folder with other people who use Dropbox.</li> 
  </ul>
