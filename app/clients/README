Clients
-------

Clients are responsible for synchronizing the source folder for a blog. This synchronization occurs between the folder on the author's device and the folder on Blot's server.


How to register a new client
----------------------------

1. Create a new folder containing the code for the client in app/clients.
2. Add the new client to the exports object in app/index.js
3. The server will show the client on the dashboard if it exposes the required methods and properties.


What are clients?
-----------------

Clients must be able to receive changes from the user's folder, and transmit changes to the user's folder.

Clients may expose endpoints for authentication, periodic updates (like a sync webhook from Dropbox or a git hook). They must expose certain methods that Blot can interact with in the abstract:

Abstract clients are used for:
- writing the welcome file for new blogs
- writing preview files for drafts
- removing preview files for deleted / published drafts
- reading and writing local template files

Switching between clients should be seamless. Disconnecting and reconnecting should have no effect. The user's blog should not visibly change until they make a modification to their folder through whichever client is currently connected. 


Specification
--------------------

Clients must have the following properties and methods:

- display_name: a string used on the dashboard e.g. 'Dropbox'
- description: a string used on the dashboard, e.g. 'A service that makes all of a userâ€™s files...',
- disconnect: a function to disassociate a site with a dropbox account
- remove: a function to remove a file in the user's dropbox folder
- write: a function to write a file to the user's dropbox folder

and may have the following methods:

- site_routes: an Express router which needs to be mounted to the site
- dashboard_routes: an Express router which needs to be mounted to the dashboard

More abstractly: clients must be stateless. They must be able to run without issue in parallel and the server must be able to restart without issue. Blot's sync module exposes a distributed locking function that a client can use to determine whether it is safe to interact with the blog's folder.

Clients currently call Blot's sync methods, specifically Change.add and Change.drop, used when a file is created or updated, and when a file is removed.


Ideas
-----

I would like to make clients much more modular than they are now. They should just emit events, and be instatiated with path to data directory, redis port, etc... They should expose express application that can be mounted by blot too.

var gitClient = new GitClient({ ... });

server.use('/clients/git', gitClient.routes);

gitClient.on('message', function(message){
  sync(message.blog.id, message.path...);
});

It would be nice if we could test these clients independently of blot.

Perhaps clients should emit events? Something like Choidikar's events?

watcher
  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))
  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))
  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));

It would be nice if everything was decoupled: it was the client's job to synchronize the folder, and Blot's job to watch the folder for changes and to turn them into a blog? Apparently there's a performance cost to this. It would be nice to know exactly what that cost was, though.
