# Google Drive Client for Blot

This repository contains the code for Blot’s Google Drive Client, designed to handle all interactions with Google Drive for the Blot blogging platform. The client is responsible for managing shared folders, syncing changes, and facilitating smooth integration between Blot and Google Drive.

There are two 'apps', one external which requests the user's email address through the OAUTH flow.
The other is a 'service account' which has access to a Drive folder created by contact@blot.im

The service account creates a new site folder inside the Sites folder and then shares it with the user's email.

## How It Works
	1.	User Authentication:
Users log in via Blot’s external app, which captures their Google email address.
	2.	Folder Creation and Sharing:
The internal Google Drive Client uses the captured email to:
	•	Create a folder in Blot’s Google Drive account.
	•	Share the folder with the user (role=editor).
	3.	Change Tracking and Syncing:
	•	Monitor the shared folder for changes using the Google Drive API.
	•	Sync updates, including file uploads, edits, and deletions, to Blot’s server.
