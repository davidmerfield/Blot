Add new redirect URIs here:

Questions
- is there an overhead to creating the oauth2 client each time? can we safely reuse it?
- is it possible to restrict Blot's access to a single folder in the google drive?
  - it doesn't seem like it is

I believe we will need this API for drive changes:
https://developers.google.com/drive/activity/v2

Since the changes.list api doesn't return rename events, it seems.

The webhooks are now tunnelled through webhooks.blot.im using clients/webhooks.js

Test server
```
http://localhost:8822/clients/googledrive/authenticate
```
