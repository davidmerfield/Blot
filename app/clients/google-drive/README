Add new redirect URIs here:
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=quickstart-1585441405190


Questions
- is there an overhead to creating the oauth2 client each time? can we safely reuse it?
- is it possible to restrict Blot's access to a single folder in the google drive?
  - it doesn't seem like it is


I believe we will need this API for drive changes:
https://developers.google.com/drive/activity/v2

Since the changes.list api doesn't return rename events, it seems.


Test server
```
http://localhost:8822/clients/googledrive/authenticate
```
