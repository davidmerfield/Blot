# Google Drive Client for Blot

This repository contains the code for Blotâ€™s Google Drive Client, designed to handle all interactions with Google Drive for the Blot blogging platform. The client is responsible for managing shared folders, syncing changes, and facilitating smooth integration between Blot and Google Drive.

Right now we ask the user for their Google Drive email.

The service account will automatically accept sharing requests sent to it.

How is storage usage affected by 'service accounts'?
- it seems like each service account gets its own storage quota of 15GB!?

Do multiple service accounts share the same storage quota? If we upgrade the storage size and have this affect all service accounts?
- No they do not share the same quota

## How to add a new service account

Service accounts are robot google drive accounts which sync the user's folder to Blot's server. The user shares their site folder through Google Drive with the service account, which in turn calls Blot.

1. Create a Google Account and open the cloud console:

https://console.cloud.google.com

2. Go to 'Enabled APIs & services' and enable:

Google Drive API 	

3. Create a service account

Service account name: Blot
Service account ID: drive-a

Do not grant any permissions (skip, skip)

4. Create a key

Add key > Create new key > JSON

Download the JSON and then run:

node scripts/google-drive/convertCredentialJSON <path to credentials.json>

This script produces a new env variable. Copy/paste the output into the env file:
- in development: ~/Projects/blot/.env
- in production: /etc/blot/secrets.env

5. Reload the server
