# Google Drive Client for Blot

This repository contains the code for Blotâ€™s Google Drive Client, designed to handle all interactions with Google Drive for the Blot blogging platform. The client is responsible for managing shared folders, syncing changes, and facilitating smooth integration between Blot and Google Drive.

Right now we ask the user to type in their Google Drive email. We avoid doing any sort of OAUTH because this involves Google  more than is strictly neccessary.

After inserting their email address, the user is asked to create a new folder in their drive and then share it with a service account controlled by Blot.

Google Drive service accounts automatically accept sharing requests sent to them, which is handy.

How is storage usage affected by 'service accounts'?
- it seems like each service account gets its own storage quota of 15GB

Do multiple service accounts share the same storage quota? If we upgrade the storage size and have this affect all service accounts?
- No they do not share the same quota

## How to add a new service account

Service accounts are robot google drive accounts which sync the user's folder to Blot's server. The user shares their site folder through Google Drive with the service account, which in turn calls Blot.

1. Create a Google Account and open the cloud console:

https://console.cloud.google.com

2. Go to 'Enabled APIs & services' and enable:

Google Drive API 	
Google Drive Activity API

3. Create a service account

Service account name: Blot
Service account ID: drive-a

Do not grant any permissions (skip, skip)

4. Create a key

Add key > Create new key > JSON

Download the JSON and then run:

node scripts/google-drive/convertCredentialJSON <path to credentials.json>

This script produces a new env variable. Copy/paste the output into the env file:
- in development: ~/Projects/blot/.env
- in production: /etc/blot/secrets.env

5. Reload the server

## New update from Google:

Previously, Google Cloud IAM service accounts had access to 15 GB of Google Workspace Storage. However, because they aren't directly managed by administrators, any new service accounts created after April 15, 2025, won't receive this storage. Existing service accounts created before this date will retain their storage.
