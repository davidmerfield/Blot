<p>CHICAGO, July 31.—The Baltimore and Ohio New York and Washington passenger vestibuled limited train from the East, which was due to arrive in the Grand Central Station, Chicago, at 9 o'clock tonight, was stopped by five masked men at 8 o'clock between Edgemore and Grand Calumet Heights, Ind., thirty-one miles out from Chicago. One of the mail cars which contained no money was blown up with dynamite and wrecked. The attempt at robbery was made after the two mail cars had been detached from the train and run a quarter of a mile ahead. 
</p><p>The failure of the robbers to make a rich haul was due to the fact that the express car which contained the train's treasure was in an unusual place. It was the third car in the train. After wrecking the mail car and obtaining no booty, the robbers disappeared in the darkness. The only loot that they carried away was the gold watch of the engineer. Most of the trainmen were shot at, but none was injured either by the dynamite or firearms. 
</p><p>The train was running at high speed as it passed Calumet Heights, and immediately after passing out of sight of the station Engineer J. W. Collins saw directly in front of his engine a large fire on which some rails had been placed. He slowed down, and as he did so three men wearing masks jumped into the cab, and covered Collins and his fireman, James Whipple, with revolvers. Just before climbing into the cab the three men discharged their revolvers. The shots caused a panic in the sleeping cars, where the passengers made every effort to hide their money and valuables before the robbers could get at them. No attempt was made, however, to rob any of the passengers. 
</p><p>After mounting the cab of the engine, the robbers, covering the engineer and fireman with their revolvers, made them step down, and go back the length of two cars. They ordered the men to uncouple the first two cars, which was done. They then hustled the two trainmen back into the cab, and still keeping the engineer covered with revolvers, directed him to pull up some distance from the rest of the train. 
</p><p>Collins ran up 200 feet and was then directed to stop. He did so, and while one of the men remained to guard him, the others jumped off, and, hurling dynamite at the door of the car which they judged to be the express car, burst open the door. Hastily climbing in to get the safe, they were astonished to find that they had broken open a mail car. 
</p><p>They threatened the engineer with death for not telling them that the cars which he had uncoupled were not express cars, and ordered him to return at once and uncouple the next car behind the baggage cars. Climbing once more into his cab, Collins backed his engine down, coupled onto the third car, which the fireman was made to uncouple at the rear end, and still with the muzzle of the revolver at hie head, Collins was ordered to run down the track as before. He drew away from the remainder of the train about the same distance as on the first occasion, and the robbers, still leaving him under the charge of one of their number, made for this car. When they reached it they found, to their wrath, that they had attacked another mail car, and that it contained no money.
</p><p>The train had been delayed now fully thirty minutes, and fearing that if they delayed it any longer help would be coming to the train crew, the robbers gave up their attempt and disappeared in a thicket of scrub oaks at the side of the track. 
</p><p>The train was hastily made up and came on to Chicago, arriving here late, a stop having been made at Whiting to report the robbery. Policemen were at once sent after the robbers, and within an hour after a large posse was on their trail. 
</p><p>F. A. Applegate of Newark, Ohio, was the express messenger and was alone in his car. He had no idea that a robbery was being attempted until he heard the shooting on the outside. He then seized a rifle, and climbing on the top of the safe awaited developments, determined to make the best fight in his power. He was not molested in any way. He said that there was considerable gold and silver in the car, and that the robbers might have secured a rich booty if they had come to the right place. 
</p><p>"I had no idea of what I was, going to do," said Appelgate. "except that I had made up my mind that there was going to be a fight, and that I was going to do the best I could." 
</p><p>Local express officials refused to say tonight how much money there was in the car. 
</p><p>It is estimated that $50,000 was stored in the express car, and it is believed the robbers knew of the large amount of money 
and valuables aboard.
