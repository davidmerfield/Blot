<h1>Hindoo Temples at Agouree, on the River Soane, Bahar.</h1>
<p>AGOUREE is pleasantly situated on the river Soane, surrounded with hills well covered with wood. In this place are many Hindoo temples, and also a small fort, which make a very picturesque appearance from the river.</p>
<p>Agouree is a place of worship of the greatest antiquity, which is obvious from the fragments of sculptured idols frequently to be met with there. The village at present is not very considerable.</p>
<p>The large tree in this view is the Banyan or Buhr.</p>
<p>Agouree is about fifty miles south from Chunar Gur.</p>
