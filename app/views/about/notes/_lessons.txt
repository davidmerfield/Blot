# Mistakes  

This page describes some of the poor decisions I have made.

## Charging annually, rather than monthly

For the first few years of business, Blot asked its customers to pay once a year. This had the following benefits:
- lower transaction fees
- money up front

Charging monthly reduces the commitment involved, and although it's hard to know if this is mere correlation, the number of customers increased when I made the switch. It makes sense to me that more people are willing to take the plunge when the initial commitment required is 30 days. I also got far fewer requests for refunds â€“ I always issue refunds when asked, but it takes time to do this, and increases the cost of support.

## Not having a clear pricing page

Initially I only showed the price of the service on the sign-up page.

## Not accepting PayPal

Adding additional payment methods immediately increased Blot's revenue. 

## Bad habits when providing support to customers

- **Asking the customer to provide information that is easy to look up**

  I often find myself asking the customer information that I could look up with a little effort (*what's the URL to your site? which blog post are you having that issue with?*). Responding with even a single question back makes it much more likely the customer will lose interest in the issue, which sometimes feels like solving the problem, but really isn't.

- **Taking too long to respond**

  When the customer's inquiry involves a bug whose solution is easy, I found myself waiting to fix the bug before responding to the customer. The proper way to handle things is first to respond saying I am fixing the problem, then follow up with a response when the problem is fixed, rather than leave the customer in the dark until the problem is fixed.

- **Avoiding responsibility for mistakes**

  When a bad bug in our product affects a customer, I found it easy to use language which seperated myself from the bug. I find it annoying when people fail in their job and don't take responsibility for it. I don't want to do that myself, although it is tempting.

- **Mistyping the customer's name**
  
  I have made too many errors transcribing a customer's name from memory. I now copy and paste the name to avoid these mistakes.

- **Constantly checking my support inbox**

  I often find myself aimlessly refreshing the inbox for supoprt requests when I should be working. I also find myself distracted by a new support
