# How to forward API webhooks to development environment

DROPBOX API <====> webhooks.blot.im ====> local server when online
GOOGLE API

The webhooks are relayed from Blot's production server to a client running when our development server is online.

They relay is secured by a shared secret in CONFIG between production and development environment

The production server always RETURNS OK so that Dropbox/Google don't stop sending webhooks when the local server is offline

There's a SSE connection between Blot's production server and this local client.

All the code is in clients/webhooks.js

Right now, all requests to webhook relay are serialized then broadcast using redis pub/sub. If there's a connected client, they recieve the serialzed request and its then up to the client to 're-create' it

There's some custom logic for handling OAUTH redirects and webhook verification
