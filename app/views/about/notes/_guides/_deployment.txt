# Deployment

There are a few things you can reboot, which are ordered here from least to most effort:
- relaunch the node.js worker processes which serve requests
- relaunch the node.js master process which manages worker processes
- relaunch the operating system on which Blot runs (AWS console -> EC2 -> Reboot instance)
- reprovision the hardware on which Blot's VPS runs (AWS console -> EC2 -> Stop instance -> Start instance)

To deploy if the changes do no affect anything in `app/scheduler` or in `app/index.js`:
merely fetch the code, update any dependencies and relaunch the node.js worker processes:

$ git pull
$ npm ci
$ node scripts/reboot

To deploy new code if the changes affect `app/scheduler` or `app/index.js`:

$ git pull
$ npm ci
$ sudo stop blot && sudo start blot
