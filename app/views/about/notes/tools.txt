# Tools

Not much software is needed to run the day-to-day operation of Blot. 

## Email

We communicate amongst ourselves and with our customers using email. Email is good because it is asynchronous and decentralized.

## Analytics

We don't gather analytics data. There are no metrics and there are no A/B tests. When we make design or engineering decisions we rely on our judgement and trust in our taste.

## Task tracking

We use [a text-file](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/blob/master/TODO) to keep track of tasks. If somebody needs to be notified when a task is complete, we include a link to the appropriate email thread in the text file, along with a description of the task. This text-file is checked into version control which means we can easily summarize our completed tasks – the [updates page](/news) is generated from this file. 

## Accounting

We use a spreadsheet which we update once per month with revenue and costs. Our costs are as follows:
- Hosting (AWS, Bunny)
- Payment processing fees (Stripe and PayPal)
- Domain registration (AWS and Cloudflare)
- Email hosting (Google Workspace) 
- Status monitoring (Updown.io)
- Other software (Microsoft Office, iCloud, TurboTax)

At the end of the year we use TurboTax to generate our tax documents.

## Payment processing

We use Stripe and PayPal to process payments.
