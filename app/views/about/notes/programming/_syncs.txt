# Sync strategy

// handle renames without a load of tedious calls to Dropbox

// need to resolve path to 'blog folder' as soon as possible
// and handle changes to 'blog folder' if users has multiple blogs inside dropbox

-> use information in local state? this seems smart...
-> why not handle all rename logic locally?

// focus on using Dropbox to keep a folder in sync

what happens if a file moves while it is downloading?

expose three commands

set (add / update)
move (also guessed from drops & sets)
drop
