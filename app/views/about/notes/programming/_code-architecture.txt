# Strategy for making Blot more modular

## Clients
  provide a method to write a file to a path
  provide a method to remove a file to a path

  expose some routes which express can mount to /clients/{{name}}
  which configure the client for the blog. for git, this will
  involve initiating a repository, adding the right hooks
  and

## Converters
  map a file(s) to HTML
    expose a method to check if can convert path
    expose a method to convert path to HTML

## Plugins
  transform HTML based on blog preference

---

each blog has a sync property?

how to deal with multiple blogs in same dropbox?

Blot.add(blogID, path, callback);
Blot.drop(blogID, path, callback);

  blot handles renames behind the scenes

Client.write(blogID, path, contents, callback);
Client.remove(blogID, path, callback);

clients should only need to keep the folder in

  blogs/{{ID}}/folder/

in sync with the user's blog folder and nothing more
