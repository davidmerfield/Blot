<h2>Why does Blot cost money?</h2>

<p>
  So that Blot can operate in your interests rather than those of
  advertisers or investors. Your subscription pays for the servers which host
  your site. We do not make money in any other way. We do not sell your data or the data of your readers.
</p>


<h2>Can I host Blot on my own server?</h2>

<p>
  Yes, Blot’s <a href="/about/source-code">source code</a> is dedicated to the
  public domain.
</p>

<h2>Can I pay annually instead of monthly?</h2>
<p>
  Yes, once you have signed up for Blot you can switch your billing interval
  from once per month to once per year on the
  <a href="/account/subscription">subscription page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Subscription renewals</h2>
<p>
  If you pay for Blot annually, we will email you one week before your
  subscription is renewed to give you time to cancel your subscription or update
  your billing information. If you forget to cancel in time,
  <a href="/support">contact us</a> and we'll issue a refund.
</p>

<h2>Canceling your subscription</h2>
<p>
  You can cancel your subscription on the
  <a href="/account/subscription">account page</a>. You can choose to
  <a href="/account/subscription/delete">delete your account</a> immediately, or
  wait until the end of your billing period.
</p>


<h2>Payment processing</h2>
<p>
  Blot uses <a rel="nofollow" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://paypal.com/">PayPal</a> to process
  subscription payments.
</p>


<h2>Exporting your site</h2>

<p>
  If you decide to move away from Blot in future, you can also export your site to the Wordpress format, which is useful for migrating a site to another platform.
