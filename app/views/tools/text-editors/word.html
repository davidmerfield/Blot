    <h2>Step 1: Prepare Your Document</h2>
    <p>Create your content in Microsoft Word. Ensure to use styles like headings, lists, and tables to structure your document effectively, as these can be translated into HTML markings.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 2: Export to DOCX</h2>
    <p>Once your content is ready, save the document in the DOCX format. This format is necessary as it is what will be converted into HTML.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 3: Convert DOCX to HTML</h2>
    <p>Use your static site generator's DOCX conversion tool. Upload your DOCX file, and the tool will automatically convert it into HTML code suitable for your website. Check the converted HTML for any necessary adjustments.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 4: Integrate and Deploy</h2>
    <p>Integrate the generated HTML into your site's content structure. Depending on your static site generator, you might need to place the HTML files in a specific directory. Finally, deploy your site to see the changes live.</p>
    
    <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Utilize the “Styles” feature in Word extensively to maintain consistent formatting.</li>
        <li>Regularly update both your Word document and the corresponding HTML to keep the site content fresh.</li>
    </ul>
