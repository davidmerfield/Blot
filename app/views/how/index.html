<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p style="margin-top: 0;">Blot turns a folder into a website. Files become posts on your site. Drag-and-drop to publish. There’s no interface, just files, so you can use your favorite tools. You can create all sorts of sites with Blot: blogs, photography sites, portfolios and much more. Fundamentally, they all work the same way.</p>

<h2>Sub-folders</h2>
<p>You can organize your folder however you like. By default, files inside becomes posts. However, Blot treats files in the following folders differently:</p>
{{> sub_folder_list}}

<h2><a href="/how/posts">Files</a></h2>
{{> supported_file_list}}

{{> ignore_file}}

<h2>Your folder is public</h2>

<p>The files in your site’s folder are public. This is useful if you want to embed an image, a video or an audio file in a post. You can also use this to share files with your readers. For example, given the folder below, your readers can download <em>Archive.zip</em> if they visit <em>/Files/Archive.zip</em> on your site.</p>
