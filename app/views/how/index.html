<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>Blot turns a folder into a website. Files in the folder be­come posts and pages on your website. </p>

<div style="max-width: 600px;" >
  {{> video}}
</div>

<h2><a href="/how/posts">Files and posts</a></h2>
{{> supported_file_list}}

<h2 >Sync your folder</h2>
{{> client_list}}

<h2>Prevent a file becoming a post</h2>
<p> Files and folders whose names start with an underscore do not become posts or pages. You can link to or <a href="#files-in-your-folder-are-public">embed them in posts</a>.</p>

<h2>Files in your folder are public</h2>

<p>The files in your site’s folder are public. This is useful if you want to embed an image, a video or an audio file in a post. You can also use this to share files with your readers. For example, given the folder below, your readers can download <em>Archive.zip</em> if they visit <em>/Files/Archive.zip</em> on your site.</p>

<pre class="folder" title="Your site"><code>Files
  Archive.zip
  index.html
Posts




</code></pre>
