<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>Blot turns a folder into a website. Files in the folder be­come posts on your website. </p>

<h2>Prevent a file becoming a post</h2>
<p> Files and folders whose name starts with an underscore are ignored. Ignored files don’t become blog posts themselves but you can link to or <a href="#files-in-your-folder-are-public">embed them in posts</a>.</p>

<h2>Drafts</h2>

<p>Files in a folder called <em>Drafts</em> are not published to your site. Instead, Blot creates a preview file which updates as you make changes.  You can share the preview file with others. Preview files should be opened in your web browser and require an internet connection.</p>

<h2>Files in your folder are public</h2>

<p>The files in your blog’s folder are public. This is useful if you want to embed an image, a video or an audio file in a blog post. You can also use this to share files with your readers. For example, given the folder below, your readers can download <em>Archive.zip</em> if they visit <em>/Files/Archive.zip</em> on your blog.</p>

<background><pre class="folder" title="Your blog"><code>Files
  Archive.zip
  index.html
