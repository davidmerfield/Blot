<h1>How to use Blot</h1>

<p>Blot turns a folder into a website. Files in the folder be­come posts on your website. What's the point of turning a folder into a website? So you can blog with your favorite text-editor. There's no interface – just files.</p>

<h2>Prevent a file becoming a post</h2>
<p> Files and folders whose name starts with an underscore are ignored. Ignored files don’t become blog posts themselves but they can be <a href="#files-in-your-folder-are-public">embedded in posts</a>.</p>

<h2>Drafts</h2>

<p>Files in a folder called <em>Drafts</em> are not published. Instead, Blot creates a preview file which updates as you make changes to your draft. Preview files work on any computer connected to the internet and should be opened in your web browser. You can share the preview file with others.</p>

<h2>Files in your folder are public</h2>

<p>The files in your blog’s folder are public. This is useful if you want to embed an image, a video or an audio file in a blog post. You can also use this to share files with your readers. For example, given the folder below, your readers can download <em>Archive.zip</em> if they visit <em>/Files/Archive.zip</em> on your blog.</p>
