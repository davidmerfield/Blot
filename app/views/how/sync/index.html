</ul>

<h2>Switching your sync method</h2>

<p>You can switch your site's folder from one client to another at any point. For example, if you want to use Git instead of Dropbox, Blot will seamlessly transition your folder's contents from one to the other, and you can pick up in Git where you left off in Dropbox.</p>

<h2>Multiple blogs</h2>

<p>You can manage multiple blogs from the same account. Each blog is independent: you could use Dropbox with one and Git with another. If you have multiple blogs, they can all use the same Dropbox account, or different accounts.</p>
