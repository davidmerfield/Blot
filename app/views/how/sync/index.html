<h2>Switching your sync method</h2>

<p>
  You can switch your site's folder from one client to another at any point. For
  example, if you want to use Git instead of Dropbox, Blot will seamlessly
  transition your folder's contents from one to the other, and you can pick up
  in Git where you left off in Dropbox.
</p>

<h2>Multiple sites</h2>

<p>
  You can manage multiple sites from the same account. Each site is independent:
  you could use Dropbox with one and Git with another. If you have multiple
  sites, they can all use the same Dropbox account, or different accounts.
