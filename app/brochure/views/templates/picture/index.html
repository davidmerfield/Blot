	The Picture template features a feed of recently published images on its index
	page.

	The purpose of the 'Picture' template is to display photos. Its navigation
	should get out of the way when you are looking at photos. It should offer a
	way to browse photos at different sizes. The homepage shows a feed a of
	recently published photos. The
	<a href="{{{preview}}}/archives">archives</a> give an overview of all the
	photos published on this site.

	Georgia Kareola’s <a href="https://notapipe.today">website</a> is the source
	of the layout for this template. I like the menu’s grid and the typography of
	the subpages in particular.

	Hofstede’s <a href="http://www.hofstede.com.au/">archives page</a> has a
	really pleasing hover effect, with the thumbnail for the hovered link
	displayed to the left.

	I tried to keep things as quiet as possible. When designing a theme, it’s easy
	to get lost in the ornamentation of the theme’s <em>chrome</em>, its menu bar,
	its search field. I tried to focus on the details. Here are a few things which
	I have done to this template which might not meet the eye:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			Thumbnails are never cropped. They are always displayed in the aspect
			ratio chosen by the photographer. To do otherwise seemes rude. Of course,
			this complicates the layout but that is my job. I think that layouts which
			do not respect the aspect ratio chosen by the photographer are lazy.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			The pagination on the index page uses your system typeface’s
			<a
				href="https://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fontology/level-3/numbers/proportional-vs-tabular-figures"
				>tabular numbers</a
			>
			feature, where possible. This prevents the width of the page indicator
			changing.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			The years in the footer indicate the range of published works. It
			sometimes looks a little silly if you have only published this year but
			just be patient!
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			When there is no pagination, we instead list the number of entries
			displayed on the page to maintain the balance of the navigation’s layout.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			This template just hides all of Blot’s search functionality, since it’s
			not as useful for photos.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			The thumbnail’s computed width and height is used to block out the layout
			of the index page before the images load. This means that nothing has to
			be recalculated as each image makes its way down the tubes. This prevents
			the layout<span class="push-single"></span>
			<span class="pull-single">‘</span>shifting’, something I think makes
			websites feel flimsy.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			The fade-on-load feature for the grid of images uses a tiny amount of
			JavaScript and a css class.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
