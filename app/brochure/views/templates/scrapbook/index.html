</ul>

<p>The Scrapbook template is designed for a database of photos and links. It features a grid of small thumbnails for your posts on its index page. It prominently features the tags used on your site.</p>

  <figcaption>The homepage of the Scrapbook template features a grid of recent posts with links to view the post in full. The post's title, generated from the image's filename, is displayed under each thumbnail.</figcaption>

<p>The layout of the grid itself was taken from <a href="https://www.are.na/">Are.na</a> with a few tweaks to my taste. The global navigation is designed to get out of the way. It features prominent links to your pages and a list of the tags used on your blog. </p>

<p>You can navigate between the full posts page using the arrows on the left and right. This is heavily designed around images.</p>
