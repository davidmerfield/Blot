<h1>Account and billing</h1>

<p>A blog costs <a href="/sign-up">{{price}} per year</a>. Hosting and support is included. You are billed when you create a blog, and each year after. You can cancel your subscription at any point with a single click on the <a href="/account">account page</a>.</p>

<h2>Multiple blogs</h2>

<p>You can manage multiple blogs from the same account. Each blog is independent: you could use <a href="/clients/dropbox">Dropbox</a> with one and <a href="/clients/git">Git</a> with another. Your blogs can use the same Dropbox account, or different accounts. Each blog costs <a href="/sign-up">{{price}} per year</a>.</p>

<h2>Alternatives to Dropbox and Git</h2>

<p>
  I plan to add support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol">SFTP</a>, and finally other services like <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a>. At the moment, you can <a href="/clients">sync your blog’s folder</a> using Git or Dropbox. </p>

<h2>Subscription renewals</h2>
<p>
  I will email you one week before your subscription is renewed to give you time to cancel your subscription or update your billing information. If you forget to cancel in time, <a href="/contact">contact me</a> and I’ll send you a refund.
</p>

<h2>Bandwidth and storage limits</h2>
<p>
  There is a soft cap of 1TB of bandwidth + storage combined per year, per blog. If you exceed this, I will ask you to meet the cost of hosting your blog, or I will help you set up Blot on your own server.</p>
<p>
  Dropbox’s <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/security/banned-links#traffic">traffic limits</a> do not apply because Blot hosts the contents of your folder on its own server.
</p>

<h2>Canceling your subscription</h2>
<p>
  You can cancel your subscription on the <a href="/account">account page</a>. You can choose to <a href="/account/delete">delete your account</a> immediately, or wait until the end of your billing period.</p>

<h2>Payment processing</h2>
<p>
  Blot uses <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> to process subscription payments. This means your payment details do not touch Blot’s servers.
