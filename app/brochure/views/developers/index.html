<p>Here you’ll find a guide to developing templates for Blot. Blot's template system offers you, the developer, control of every line of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Blot's templates will be familiar to those who have developed for other platforms. </p>

<p>You will need a working knowledge of HTML and CSS. If you’d like to hire a developer or designer to create a template for you, <a href="/developers/support">contact me</a>.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>You can <a href="/theme/new">create a new template</a> on the your blog’s dashboard. You can make changes to a template using the online editor, or you can sync the template’s source files to your blog’s folder and edit them directly. All of Blot’s templates are <a href="https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/blob/master/license.txt">dedicated to the public domain</a> so you can modify and share them freely.</p>

<h2>How Blot works</h2>

<p>The template system sits on top of a plain, old-fashioned static file server. In fact, if you <a href="/settings/theme/disable">disable your blog's template</a>, Blot serves the contents of your blog's folder as-is.</p>

<h2>Rendering templates</h2>

<p>Blot’s templates will be familiar to those who have worked with other blogging platforms. They are written in <a href="/developers/rendering-templates">Mustache</a> and consist of tags which look like <code>\{{this}}</code>. These tags are replaced with the data generated by Blot when the template is rendered.</p>
