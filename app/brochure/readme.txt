# Brochure site

I found myself much more productive working on the content of the website seperately from it's design. That is, by disabling the CSS file before making any changes to the site itself, I found myself less distracted by the infinite design tweaks that could be made to a given page.

Structure of the site
---------------------

  The entire ./views directory is served as a static folder.
  This was designed to make it convenient to edit the css files.

Adding new content
------------------

  Make sure you update ./routes/sitemap.js with any new and important URLs
