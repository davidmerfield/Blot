We heard a miraculous story in Ludhiana. And this is howÂ it came about that we heard it.

I met Jass in the night market in Hualien, a small town on the east coast of Taiwan. In a country where there are very few Indians, and most of them seem to be post docs in Chemistry from Hyderabad, Jass stood out. He ran a kathi roll stand in the night market and also taught English, his wife is Taiwanese Canadian. They met while she was traveling through India, and Jass is an avid traveler, makes friends easily and is truly cosmopolitan. So much so, he taught himself English so that he could communicate with more people from all over the country and the world.

Jass is from Ludhiana, and since we were going there, we wanted to say hello to the family, which consists of his parents, grandfather, brother and a large extended family.
