This is the example org-mode file used for the Denver Emacs org-mode
introduction talk. Everything in this talk should work without any custom
settings or installation with a reasonably recent Emacs version.

Let's start with a headline, this is kind of like Markdown's # character:

* This is an example headline

Text can be put into the headline. You can create another headline at the same
level with another * character

* Another headline
Nesting headlines is as easy as adding another start

** Nested headline

** Another nested headline
