<p>This is the example org-mode file used for the Denver Emacs org-mode
introduction talk. Everything in this talk should work without any
custom settings or installation with a reasonably recent Emacs
version.</p>
<p>Let's start with a headline, this is kind of like Markdown's #
character:</p>
<h1 id="this-is-an-example-headline">This is an example headline</h1>
<p>Text can be put into the headline. You can create another headline at
the same level with another * character</p>
<h1 id="another-headline">Another headline</h1>
<p>Nesting headlines is as easy as adding another start</p>
<h2 id="nested-headline">Nested headline</h2>
<h2 id="another-nested-headline">Another nested headline</h2>
