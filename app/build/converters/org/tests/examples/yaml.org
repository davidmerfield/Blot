* Heading Level 1

The source for this post is  org-mode with both org title syntax and a yaml source block. Blot hides the org source block, and then treats the yaml block like a code block. Looking at the page source it puts org-mode block syntax in a pre tag and hljs yaml class.  So, it's treating it like code and highlighting the background, if I understand  what "highlight JavaScript" is doing, which I don't.

The sentences under heading 4 are all on separate lines but Blot puts them on one line, even if I use the markdown convention of double spaces at the end of the line, and it  doesn't do the link properly even if I use an org source block for markdown and use markdown syntax.  Again it treats it as pre hijs.
