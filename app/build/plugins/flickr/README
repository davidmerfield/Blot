Flickr oEmbed Plugin

This module converts plain Flickr URLs in HTML into embedded Flickr widgets using the Flickr oEmbed API.

Features
	•	Supports both short (flic.kr) and full (flickr.com) Flickr URLs.
	•	Automatically replaces bare links with Flickr embeds.
	•	Graceful handling of invalid URLs or API failures.

e.g. in your markdown file:

```
# Title of post

https://www.flickr.com/photos/jemostrom/54145631949/

Some text here
```

When rendered will include a flickr embed for the linked photo, rather than a plain link.
