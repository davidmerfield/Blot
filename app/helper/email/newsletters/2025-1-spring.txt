**New features**  
- You can now [sync your folder using iCloud](https://blot.im/how/sync/icloud).
- Added three new templates. Download the folders to see how Blot generates the site. The templates are:
    - [CV](https://blot.im/templates/cv) a profile page, could be used as a personal site.
    - [Documentation](https://blot.im/templates/cv) a developer docs template, could also be used for a digital garden.
    - [Event](https://blot.im/templates/cv) a template for an event suitable for conferences, lectures, parties and weddings.
- Implemented [color profile preservation](https://blot.im/how/files/images#compression-and-color-profile) for images so you can publish images using P3.
- New image formats can become posts: [TIFF, WEBP and AVIF](https://blot.im/how/files/images).
- Added new plugins which turn bare links to posts on Bluesky and Flickr into embeds.

**Changes**  
- Rewrote the [Google Drive](https://blot.im/how/sync/google-drive) integration to workaround their changes to the rules for using their API which temporarily broke syncing with Blot.
- Updated the Twitter plugin to support *x.com* URLs.  
- We updated Blot’s dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities, per tradition.  

**Bugs fixed**  
- Resolved issues with nested objects, arrays, and tags in [YAML metadata](https://blot.im/how/metadata).  
- Fixed a bug with empty renamed files.
- Fixed a bug with the markdown converted which led to the insertion of extra paragraph tags.
- Fixed a bug with PayPal subscriptions which briefly prevented the creation of additional sites.

**Questions**
- [How would one go about implementing Tufte CSS?](https://blot.im/questions/1449)
- [Image Gallery on an Ordinary Markdown Blot page?](https://blot.im/questions/2993)
- [Posting videos?](https://blot.im/questions/1753)

**Mistakes**
There were no truly catastrophic downtime incidents this season but I was plagued by a persistent issue with the connection between the reverse proxy and Blot's application server. When both of the upstreams were marked as bad at once, this led to a failwhale error page 'This site is offline'. Eventually, I worked it out: the reverse proxy was incorrectly marking the upstream application servers as offline when they were not. Eventually I worked out why: younger me was responding to requests in the application server with the wrong HTTP error codes. Damn.

**Plans for this season**
- I'm considering changing the license for Blot's code from [CC0 to GPL](https://blot.im/questions/3053). Please feel free to [respond to the question](https://blot.im/questions/3053) or this email with your thoughts.
- Add more new templates. If you have any burning requests please reply to this email.
- Improve template engine and developer documentation
- Improve the performance and reliability of Blot’s servers.

If you have any thoughts or questions about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.  

Sincerely,  
David
