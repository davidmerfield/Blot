**New features**
- Added an option to embed comments from *Commento*. You can set this up on your site’s [services page](https://blot.im/settings/services). 

**Changes**
- Increased the price for future customers to $4 per month. This has not affected existing customers in any way: you will continue to pay the same fee as usual.
- Template preview subdomains, like this [preview of the Scrapbook template](https://preview-scrapbook-on-ferox.blot.im/), are finally accessible over HTTPS. This now means that every aspect of Blot is served securely.
- Improved the [custom metadata](https://blot.im/publishing/metadata) parser. Now the first sentence of a blog post which happens to contain a colon is no longer parsed incorrectly as if it were custom metadata. Now custom metadata *keys* must be alphanumeric and contain no more than one space. Dashes and underscores are also allowed.
- Made a number of changes to the algorithm which extracts a summary for each post. Image caption text is no longer included in this summary. Whitespace is also better normalized to prevent the title entering the summary.
- Adjusted the format of the templates’ default CSS and JavaScript URLs to make them easier to cache.
- Your [custom redirects](https://blot.im/settings/services/redirects) now return an HTTP status of *301*, which indicates the redirect is permanent, instead of *302*, which indicates a temporary redirect.
- Increased the length of sessions on your blog’s dashboard to 90 days. Previously, you had to log in again after each browser session.
- Updated Blot’s dependencies to their latest stable version and redesigned the dashboard and documentation, as is tradition.

**Bugs fixed**
- Fixed a bug in the appearance of one of the default date formats which produced dates that look like *2020-03-19 18:00*. Previously, a post pushed at 6pm would appear as *06:00* instead of *18:00*.
- Fixed a problem with the git client and files whose names contain non-ASCII characters. By default, the *git diff* command returns non-ASCII characters in quoted octal notation, i.e. *\nnn\nnn*. The git client can now properly handle this encoding.
- Fixed a series of bugs which occurred when you switched from the Dropbox client to the git client. These were triggered by the difference in the handling of case-sensitivity: Dropbox is case-insensitive, git is not.
- Fixed a bug which prevented the inclusion of particular pages on your blog’s sitemap.
- Fixed a number of bugs triggered by Mustache’s default character escaping for URLs. Thank you Marlin for working on this.

**Mistakes**

Firstly, I’m sorry. There was too much downtime this winter. Blot was unavailable for a total of 21 hours across a series of incidents, most of which occurred in November. This is unacceptable. Blot continues to grow and this growth continues to expose flaws in the architecture of the service. To mitigate some of these flaws, I’m working on integrating redundant servers into Blot’s infrastructure. 

**Plans for this season**
- Continue to improve Blot’s infrastructure.
- Since template previews are now served over HTTPS, I can embed this preview inside the template editor, which is the final piece required to finish the point-and-click customization for Blot’s templates. You will soon be able to change the typeface on your template with a dropdown menu, and set your template’s colour scheme with a colour picker.
- Spend some time marketing Blot. I plan to release a new demonstration video, and publish the field notes I’ve taken over the years.

If you have any questions at all about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Take care, David
