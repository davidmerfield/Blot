**New features**
- Blot now extracts thumbnails from videos in your posts. This makes a big difference if you post videos and use a template like [Reference](https://blot.im/templates/reference), [Photo](https://blot.im/templates/photo) or [Portfolio](https://blot.im/templates/portfolio), with thumbnails on their index pages.
- Link posts, [generated from bookmark files](https://blot.im/how/posts/bookmarks), now include a screenshot of the linked site. This feature is turned on for new blogs. If you have an existing blog, you’ll need to enable ‘Add a screenshot to posts from bookmarks’ on [the services page](https://blot.im/settings/services) of your dashboard.
- We added a new ‘random entry’ feature. If you add a link to */random* to [your site’s menu](https://blot.im/settings/links), you’ll be redirected to a random post each time you click.
- You can now download the source folders for the test sites used to [preview the templates](https://blot.im/templates).
- We added features required by educational institutions to create and manage a large number of student accounts.
- The [folder settings page](https://blot.im/settings/client) of your dashboard now includes a log of the changes you make to your folder.

**Changes**
- We adjusted the format of the URLs on your blog’s dashboard so they include the username of the blog you are editing.
- You can now connect multiple blogs to the same [Google Drive](https://blot.im/how/sync/google-drive) account.
- We improved the appearance of [equations set with TeX](https://blot.im/how/posts/tex) by updating the typefaces and KaTeX compiler to their latest versions.
- We updated Blot's dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities and made tweaks to the dashboard and documentation, per tradition.

**Bugs fixed**
- We generally improved the reliability of the [Dropbox client](https://blot.im/how/sync/dropbox).
- We fixed a bug with the [Google Drive client](https://blot.im/how/sync/google-drive) which occurred when you moved a file from within your blog folder into another folder in your Google Drive.
- Emojis now appear correctly in text files served by Blot.
- We fixed an issue with Blot’s [Commento integration](https://blot.im/how/configure/comments) caused by trailing slashes.
- You can now adjust the colors on the [Blog template](https://blot.im/templates/blog).
- The [Magazine template](https://blot.im/templates/magazine)’s pagination now works as expected on smaller screens.

**Questions**

Here are a few highlights from [Questions](https://blot.im/questions), a section of Blot’s site where you can ask and answer questions:

- [Does Blot use Blot?](https://blot.im/questions/525)
- [Setting up GitHub with Blot and Obsidian](https://blot.im/questions/642)
- [Getting the first item in an entries array](https://blot.im/questions/577)
- [How to have page URLs which mirror folder structure?](https://blot.im/questions/578)

**Mistakes**

I was overwhelmed by my inbox a few times recently, which led to unacceptable delays in responding to some of your questions and bug reports. I plan to hire someone to help with this.

Also, I mistakenly allowed the wildcard certificate, which is used to secure traffic to Blot’s template previews, to expire. This certificate now renews itself automatically and is now monitored externally.

**Plans for this season**

We have begun work on an iCloud client. In the past, you might have received a message from me saying ‘We’d love to support iCloud but Apple doesn’t offer the necessary APIs’. However, [Jon](https://jon.bo/) came up with a clever plan and we’re going to make it work.

If you have any thoughts or questions about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
