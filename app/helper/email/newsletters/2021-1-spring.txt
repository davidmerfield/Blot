**New features**
- The [question and answer](https://blot.im/questions) forum is now open to everyone who uses Blot. It should become a useful resource and perhaps one day, a way to interact with others who use Blot. [Rakhim](https://rakhim.org/) worked on this and I’m proud of the result.
- You can now use *punycode* domains with Blot.
- We added [Cloudflare web analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/) to the selection of analytics services on your dashboard.
- You can now set up [redirects to external URLs](https://blot.im/settings/services/redirects).
- Added an option to format all post headings in *Title Case* to [the services page](https://blot.im/settings/services) of your dashboard. 

**Changes**
- Improved the reliability of the server – now we can deploy changes to Blot’s code without dropping a single request to your site. 
- Updated the tools Blot depends on to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
- Tweaked the design of the documentation and the dashboard, per tradition.

**Bugs fixed**
- Fixed a bug [with tag folders](https://blot.im/how/metadata#set-tags-using-your-folder) and the Dropbox client. Previously a file in a Dropbox folder called *\[Apple\]* would have been tagged *apple*, now it is tagged *Apple*.
- The markdown converter now correctly handles ampersands – previously they were incorrectly encoded twice under particular conditions. 
- Fixed the [bulk redirect editor](https://blot.im/settings/services/redirects) on your dashboard.
- Fixed a number of broken URLs on the public site.

**Mistakes**

There were [no major downtime incidents](https://status.blot.im/) this season, everything ran fairly smoothly. There were brief and intermittent periods of unresponsiveness which I intend to resolve as soon as possible.

**Plans for this season**

- Begin collecting proper measurements for page-rendering speed on the server. This will help us identify ways to improve the speed of your site.
- Add support for \[\[Wikilinks\]\]. This will make Blot an effective companion for tools like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
- Work on the templates, particularly the underlying template engine.
- Finally release the Google Drive client.

If you have any thoughts or questions about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
