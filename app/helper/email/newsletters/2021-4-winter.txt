**New features**
- You can now sync your blog’s folder using [Google Drive](https://blot.im/how/sync/google-drive).
- Added a script to [import posts from Micro.blog](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/tree/master/app/dashboard/routes/importer/sources/micro.blog). The script generates a directory of Markdown and image files in format suitable for Blot. If you would like us to run this script on your behalf, please [send us](https://blot.im/contact) your [Micro.blog export](https://help.micro.blog/t/exporting-from-micro-blog/557) in the Wordpress format.
- You can customize all the colors of the [Magazine template](https://blot.im/templates/magazine) on the web template editor using the point-and-click controls, no need to edit the CSS.

**Changes**
- Updated the [Photo template](https://blot.im/templates/photo)’s archives page.
- Adjusted the [Simple Analytics](https://blot.im/how/configure/analytics) script to conform to their revised format.
- Overrode ’Command + S’ on the web template editor so that it now saves any changes you have made to the template, rather than opening the browser’s ’Save page’ dialog. 
- Updated the tools Blot depends upon to patch any known security vulnerabilities.

**Bugs fixed**
- Disconnecting a partially-setup Dropbox client used to trigger an error. This edge-case is now properly handled.

**Mistakes**

We had [one downtime incident](http://status.blot.im/) on the 15th of December for less than 20 minutes when one of the server’s processes ran out of memory.

I have been less focussed than I ought to be. I will improve for spring.

**Plans for this season**
- Continue to improve the templates. 
- Work on improving the load time of blogs.
- Begin marketing Blot. If you have any idea how we could publicize Blot in a tasteful way, please let us know. We’re unwilling to advertise, which limits our options.

If you have any thoughts or questions about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
