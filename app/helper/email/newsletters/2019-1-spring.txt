**New features**


I made some additions to the [guide](https://blot.im/publishing) and [developer documentation](https://blot.im/developers). There's a new section on [the Git and Dropbox clients](https://blot.im/publishing/clients). I also designed two new templates:
  
- [Photos](https://blot.im/templates/photos)
- [Portfolio](https://blot.im/templates/portfolio) 


**Changes**

- Adjusted the design of the dashboard and documentation, as is tradition.
- Improved the script which imports posts from Wordpress. 
- The analytics plugin now respects your readers' DNT privacy settings.
- Added some scripts to analyse Blot's access log so that I can monitor the performance of Blot's server
- Video embeds now use Youtube's cookie-free domain.
- Resolved any known security vulnerabilities in Blot's dependencies and updated them as needed.

**Bugs fixed**

- Fixed an vintage bug with Blot's metadata parser which incorrectly interpreted a URL on the first line of the file as metadata.
- Customers hosting multiple blogs using Blot's [Git client](https://blot.im/publishing/clients/git) now no longer need to re-authenticate when they switch blog.
- Rate limit errors from Dropbox are now handled appropriately.
- Images in posts generated from Word Documents can now become thumbnails.
- As is tradition, I introduced and then fixed a number of caching bugs.


**Mistakes**

There were two downtime incidents over winter. I made adjustments to Blot's infrastructure to prevent their causes recurring:

- The first period of downtime began after the disk attached to Blot's main server ran out of space. Blot's database couldn't persist on disk and began to error. I was travelling for Christmas in the UK and managed to SSH into Blot's server from my phone, wipe a few unneeded log files to give me enough time to attach a substantially larger disk. I have now set up dedicated alerts when disk space starts to run low. This was embarrassing and will not happen again.
- The second downtime incident was caused by a bug in the system I set up to monitor the health of processes on Blot's server. Unknown to me, Upstart was losing track of NGINX's process and subsequent attempts by Monit to restart NGINX triggered a death-spiral. I temporarily solved the issue by turning Blot's server off-and-on. I have since fixed the Upstart script which manages NGINX.

Another mistake I made over winter: I turned off Blot's CDN, hoping to reduce the latency between you adding a file to your folder and the post appearing on your site. I also hoped to reduce the time-to-first-byte of images on your site, since the unwarmed cache of Blot's CDN had rather mixed performance. 

However, I discovered that disabling Blot's CDN dramatically reduced the available bandwidth and increased the download time for images and other large files on your site. After a long investigation, I realised this was caused by the [bandwidth-delay product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product) which affects TCP. Did you know that latency affects bandwidth for some internet protocols? I didn't. All in all, I spent too much time working out from first principles why CDNs are useful. At least I learnt about the internet in the process.

**Plans for this season**

I will restart Blot's CDN so that images on your blog download quickly again. I will then focus on Blot's template system for the next few months. I'd also like to continue my research on existing blogging platforms and publish these notes online.

[Paul](https://github.com/Pinjasaur) has been kindly contributing to Blot's code since January. We managed to get Blot running on Paul's machine and we wrote a [guide to setting up Blot in a development environment](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/blob/master/config/guides/development-environment.md). This is an important step towards encouraging people to self-host Blot, which is one of my long-term goals.

If you have any questions at all about any of this, please don't hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
