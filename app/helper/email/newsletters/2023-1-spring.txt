**New features**
- You can now [import a Wordpress site](https://blot.im/settings/services/import) on your dashboard. The importer generates a Markdown file for each post, preserves the post’s URL and downloads any images.
- Your dashboard now has tools to [reset and re-sync your folder](https://blot.im/settings/client/reset).
- Your [questions](https://blot.im/questions) are now organized by tag.

**Changes**
- [Wikilinks](https://blot.im/how/posts/wikilinks) now work better. Blot looks up the linked post by title, URL or file name in a more flexible manner.
- Errors with [locally edited templates](https://blot.im/templates/developers) now appear on your template’s preview subdomain, which makes template development less frustrating.
- The algorithm which converts characters with diacritics for [custom link formats](https://blot.im/how/configure/link-format) now handles diacritics which should translate to multiple characters. For example, ‘þ’ now becomes ‘th’, ‘ß’ now becomes ‘ss’, and so forth.
- When you switch from git to another method of [syncing your folder](https://blot.im/how/sync), Blot now removes the git repository in your folder.
- We updated Blot’s dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities and made tweaks to the dashboard and documentation, per tradition.

**Bugs fixed**
- We improved the reliability of folders synced with [Google Drive](https://blot.im/how/sync/google-drive) in various ways. 
- Invalid [YAML metadata](https://blot.im/how/metadata) no longer prevents a post from appearing on your site.
- [Scheduled entries](https://blot.im/how/metadata#scheduling-a-post-for-publication) no longer appear as backlinks before they are published.
- Tags now display correctly on the [Photo template](https://blot.im/templates/photo)’s archives page.

**Questions**

Here are a few highlights from [Questions](https://blot.im/questions), a section of Blot’s site where you can ask and answer questions:
- [How to password-protect a site?](https://blot.im/questions/1)
- [Is it possible to get the length of the post?](https://blot.im/questions/1502)
- [Multi-file post syntax?](https://blot.im/questions/1251)
- [Moving and styling citations?](https://blot.im/questions/298)
- [What new methods of syncing a folder would you like?](https://blot.im/questions/1387)

**Mistakes**

Until recently, I worked on [Blot’s code](https://blot.im/about/source-code) using a case-*insensitive* file system. However, Blot is tested and deployed on a case-sensitive file system. This inconsistency obscured a great variety of bugs. I now work on Blot’s code using a case-sensitive file system and am making progress on these bugs.

**Plans for this season**

We plan to finish the iCloud client. We will also improve the demonstration video and add more importers to the dashboard – at the moment you can [import from Wordpress](https://blot.im/settings/services/import) and we plan to add support for Ghost, Substack, Jekyll, Tumblr, Squarespace and many other services.

If you have any thoughts or questions about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.
