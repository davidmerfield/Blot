**New features**
- Added [example folders](https://blot.im/examples/folders) to the documentation. My favorite is [Sergey](https://blot.im/examples/folders/sergey), which presents color photographs of Imperial Russia from the early twentieth century taken by Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky.
- You can now specify [metadata](https://blot.im/how/posts/metadata) in [Google Docs](https://blot.im/how/posts/google-docs) and [org files](https://blot.im/how/posts/org).

**Changes**
- The thumbnail generator will no longer prioritize video embeds over embedded images within the same post.
- Our integration with [Heap analytics](https://blot.im/how/configure/analytics) now uses their new tracking script.
- *Slug* metadata can be used as part of [your link format](https://blot.im/how/configure/link-format) and is no longer an alias of *Link* or *URL* metadata.
- You can now include pages in your site’s search index using [*Search* metadata](https://blot.im/how/posts/metadata#search).
- We updated Blot’s dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities and made changes to the dashboard and documentation, per tradition.

**Bugs fixed**
- The thumbnail generator can now handle references to an image with URL-encoded punctuation in its filename.
- The [setting to use title case](https://blot.im/dashboard/settings/typography) now works for titles which start with an emoji. The title case setting also now affects titles derived from filenames.

**Questions**
- [Is there a way to embed one text file within another one?](https://blot.im/questions/2256)
- [Email subscriptions?](https://blot.im/questions/1353)
- [What have you made with Blot?](https://blot.im/questions/1635)

**Mistakes**
- There were [no major incidents](https://status.blot.im/) this season.

**Plans for this season**
- We are considering switching the domain we use for the dashboard and documentation from *blot.im* to *blot.site*. This would not affect your existing Blot subdomains. Why? I prefer the way *blot.site* looks. There is also a security benefit to using a different domain for your sites.
- Improve the performance and reliability of Blot’s servers.
- Fix a synchronization bug with [Google Drive](https://blot.im/how/sync/google-drive).
- Improve the dashboard and the templates.

If you have any thoughts or questions about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
