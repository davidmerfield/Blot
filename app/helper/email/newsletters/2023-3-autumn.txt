**New features**
- You can publish [Google Docs](https://blot.im/how/posts/google-docs), [RTF](https://blot.im/how/posts) and [Org mode](https://blot.im/how/posts/org) files as blog posts.
- HTML files in your folder are accessible at [cleaner URLs](https://blot.im/how/posts/html#pretty-urls-for-html-files-in-your-folder).
- Blot’s template editor has a point-and-click menu for font and syntax highlighting options.
- You can import an Are.na channel directly with [Blot’s importer](https://blot.im/dashboard/settings/services/import).

**Changes**
- Exact matches and queries in non-Latin alphabets now work more reliably in your site's search engine.
- Title extraction algorithm: we have adjusted the priority order in the algorithm so that Blot now uses the file name before the first sentence.
- We updated Blot’s dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities and made tweaks to the dashboard and documentation, per tradition.

**Bugs fixed**
- Files that are removed from the folder of a locally edited template are also removed from the template itself.
- You can use a series of dollar signs (e.g. $$$$) in your posts without crashing the KaTeX renderer.
- Word Documents exported from Google Docs no longer have unexpected highlighted text.

**Mistakes**

Unfortunately, the server went down in June when I was on holiday without access to a computer. I was eventually able to SSH into Blot’s main server [from my phone](https://panic.com/prompt/) and provision the resources required to get the server online. I need to automate the provisioning of new disk space. Sorry about the downtime.

**Plans for this season**

I've been working on Blot's servers for the past few months with the goal of making your sites load more quickly. Once I conclude the changes to Blot's servers, I will finish the iCloud client, then add PayPal as a payment method.

If you have any thoughts or questions about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
