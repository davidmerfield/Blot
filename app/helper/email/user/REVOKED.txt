Blot is having trouble syncing with your Dropbox

Blot just tried and failed to sync your blog posts from Dropbox.

Fixing this is simple â€“ all you have to do is [log in to Blot]({{{site}}}/account/log-out?then=/log-in).

When you've done that Blot will be able to sync your blog posts again! Feel free to reply to this email if you have any questions.

Best, David
