Warning: Blot's disk is low on space

One of the disks attached to Blot's server is running low on space:

{{#disks}}
- **{{label}}** {{available_human}} available, {{used_human}} used {{mount}}
{{/disks}}

Resolve this now:

1. [Open the AWS console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-west-2#Volumes:) and resize the relevant volume:
2. Then ssh into the server and [expand the file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/recognize-expanded-volume-linux.html):

```
sudo growpart /dev/nvme0n1 1
sudo resize2fs /dev/nvme0n1
```
