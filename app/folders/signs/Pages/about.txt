A collection of signs from the FSA-OWI photography project:

After a series of setbacks in the courts that repealed many of the First New Dealâ€™s program, President Roosevelt pursued a new set of initiatives including the Resettlement Administration in 1935. It was charged with aiding the poorest third of farmers displaced by the depression and particularly focused on resettlement on viable lands and providing low-interest loans. Directed by Rexford Tugwell, a Columbia University economist, the RA came under immediate scrutiny. Realizing the battle for public opinion had begun, Tugwell hired his former student Roy Stryker to lead the Historic Section within the Information Division of the RA, which in 1937 was moved to the FSA.

I wrote a script which pulls down the original TIFF from the Library of Congress and resizes it, saves description and dates it nicely.
