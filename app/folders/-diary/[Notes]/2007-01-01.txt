This new creature with the long hair is a good deal in the way. It is always hanging around and following me about. I don't like this; I am not used to the company. I wish it would stay with the other animals... Cloudy to-day, wind in the east; think we shall have rain... *We?* Where did I get that word? ... I remember nowâ€”the new creature uses it.
