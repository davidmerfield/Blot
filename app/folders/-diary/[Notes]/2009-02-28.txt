I examined its mouth. There is no danger yet; it has only one tooth. It has no tail yet. It makes more noise than it ever did beforeâ€”and mainly at night. I have moved out. But I shall go over, mornings, to breakfast, and to see if it has more teeth. If it gets a mouthful of teeth, it will be time for it to go, tail or no tail, for a bear does not need a tail in order to be dangerous.
