No one, presently, sees the Moon rotate like this. That's because the Earth's moon is tidally locked to the Earth, showing us [only one side](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33_tUHDkMY). Given modern digital technology, however, combined with many detailed images returned by the [Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter](http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/) (LRO), a high resolution virtual [Moon rotation movie](http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/790-A-Unique-View-Of-The-Moon.html) has been composed. The [above time-lapse video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNUNB6CMnE8) starts with the standard Earth [view of the Moon](http://www.google.com/moon/). Quickly, though, [Mare Orientale](ap110312.html), a large crater with a dark center that is difficult to see from the Earth, rotates into view just below the equator. From an entire [lunar month](http://www.universetoday.com/19699/does-the-moon-rotate/) condensed into 24 seconds, the video clearly shows that the Earth side of [the Moon](ap160201.html) contains an abundance of [dark lunar maria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_maria_on_the_Moon), while the lunar far side is dominated by bright [lunar highlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_the_Moon#Highlands). Currently, over [20 new missions to the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_the_Moon#Funded_lunar_probe_missions_currently_under_development) are under active development from four different countries, most of which have expected launch dates either this year or next.
