<h2>Drafts</h2>
<p>Blot publishes updates to your blog in real-time. Changes you make are applied instantly. Sometimes, you might want to double check a few things before publishing a post. To do this, use Blot's drafts feature. Here's how to create a draft:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a folder called 'Drafts' inside your blog's folder</li>
  <li>Put your blog post inside. Blot will create a preview file next to it.</li>
  <li>View the preview file in your browser.</li>
</ol>

<p>Instead of publishing the blog post, Blot will create a preview file. As you make changes to your blog post, Blot will update the preview in real-time.</p>
