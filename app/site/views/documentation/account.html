<h2>Account and billing</h2>

<p>A blog costs <a href="/sign-up">{{price}} per year</a>. Hosting and support is included. You are billed when you create a blog, and each year after. You can cancel your subscription at any point on the <a href="/account">account page</a>.</p>

<h3>Multiple blogs</h3>

<p>You can manage multiple blogs from the same account. Your blogs can be in the same Dropbox folder, or in different folders. Each blog costs {{price}} per year. </p>

<h3>Alternatives to Dropbox</h3>

<p>
  Blot can sync your blog’s folder using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> instead of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>. In future, I plan to add support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol">SFTP</a>, and finally other services like <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a>.</p>

<h3>Can Blot access all the files in my Dropbox?</h3>

<p>
  Blot only requests access to your blog’s folder in your Dropbox by default. However, you can choose to grant Blot <a href="/clients/dropbox">special access to your entire Dropbox</a>. You should only do this if you want to move your blog’s folder, or share it with other people who use Dropbox.
</p>

<h3>Bandwidth and storage limits</h3>
<p>
  There is a soft cap of 1TB of bandwidth + storage combined per year, per blog. If you exceed this, I will ask you to meet the cost of hosting your blog, or I will help you set up Blot on your own server.</p>
<p>
  Dropbox’s <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/security/banned-links#traffic">traffic limits</a> do not apply because Blot hosts the contents of your folder on its own server.
</p>

<h3>Subscription renewals</h3>
<p>
  I will email you one week before your subscription is renewed to give you time to cancel your subscription or update your billing information. If you forget to cancel in time, <a href="/contact">contact me</a> and I’ll send you a refund.
</p>

<h3>Canceling your subscription</h3>
<p>
  You can cancel your subscription on the <a href="/account">account page</a>. You can choose to <a href="/account/delete">delete your account</a> immediately, or wait until the end of your billing period.</p>

<h3>Payment processing</h3>
<p>
  Blot uses <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> to process subscription payments. This means your payment details do not touch Blot’s servers.
