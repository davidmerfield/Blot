<h2>About</h2>

<p>Blot is a blogging platform with no interface. It creates a special folder in your Dropbox and publishes files you put inside. The point of all this — the reason Blot exists — is so you can use your favorite tools to create whatever you publish.</p>

<h3>Why does Blot exist?</h3>

<p>I like the flexibility and simplicity of plain text files. For years I’ve used text files to store my notes. One day it occured to me that there is enough information encoded in the files—their content, metadata and location—to generate a blog, without interfering with the structure of the folder or my writing process.</p>

<h3>Why does Blot cost money?</h3>

<p>The annual fee pays for the servers which host your blog. It also covers the cost of providing support. Most importantly, it encourages Blot to operate in your best interests, as opposed to those of an advertiser or investor.</p>

<h3>Can I host Blot on my own server?</h3>

<p>Yes, <a href="https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot">Blot’s source code</a> is dedicated to the public domain.</p>
