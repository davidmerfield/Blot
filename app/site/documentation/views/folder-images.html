<h1>Embedding images in blog posts</h1>
<div class="measure">

<p>There are a few ways to insert an image into a blog post. The best way will depend on the location of the image and the type of file you’d like to use to create the blog post.</p>
<h2>Using a Word Document</h2>
<p>Just drag and drop the image into the Word Document.</p>
<h2>Using a text file</h2>
<p>You can use <a href="/formatting">Markdown</a> to embed an image in your blog's folder.</p>
</div>
<pre class="text with-chrome" title="Post"><code>Here’s the Markdown to embed an image:

![Image title](/path/to/the/_image.jpg)

Blot resolves paths relative to the location of this file. Blot resolves absolute paths with your blog’s folder as the root directory. Paths are case-insensitive. 

You can embed an image that’s already on the internet:

![Image title](https://url.of/the/image.jpg)
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that any image in your blog’s folder becomes a blog post by default. You can tell Blot <a href="/help#ignoring-files">not to turn a particular image into a blog post</a> by starting its name with an underscore, or by putting it in a folder whose name begins with an underscore.</p>
