    <h1>Account and billing</h1>

<p class="measure">A blog costs <a href="/sign-up">{{price}} per year</a>. Hosting and support is included. You are billed when you create a blog, and each year after. You can cancel your subscription at any point on the <a href="/account">account page</a>.</p>

<h2 class="measure" class="measure">Multiple blogs</h2><p class="measure">
You can manage multiple blogs from the same account. Your blogs can be in the same Dropbox folder, or in different folders. Each blog costs {{price}} per year. </p>

<h2 class="measure">Alternatives to Dropbox</h2><p class="measure">
Blot can sync your blog’s folder using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> instead of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>. In future, I plan to add support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol">SFTP</a>, and finally other services like <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a>.</p>


<h2 class="measure">Can Blot access all the files in my Dropbox?</h2><p class="measure">
Blot only requests access to your blog’s folder in your Dropbox by default. However, you can choose to grant Blot <a href="/clients/dropbox">special access to your entire Dropbox</a>. You should only do this if you want to move your blog’s folder, or share it with other people who use Dropbox.
</p>

<h2 class="measure">Bandwidth and storage limits</h2><p class="measure">
There is a soft cap of 1TB of bandwidth + storage combined per year, per blog. If you exceed this, I will ask you to meet the cost of hosting your blog, or I will help you set up Blot on your own server.</p>
<p class="measure">
Dropbox’s <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/security/banned-links#traffic">traffic limits</a> do not apply because Blot hosts the contents of your folder on its own server. 
</p>


<h2 class="measure">Subscription renewals</h2><p class="measure">
I will email you one week before your subscription is renewed to give you time to cancel your subscription or update your billing information. If you forget to cancel in time, don’t worry, just <a href="/contact">contact me</a> and I’ll send you a refund.
</p>

<h2 class="measure">Canceling your subscription</h2><p class="measure">
You can cancel your subscription on the <a href="/account">account page</a>. You can choose to <a href="/account/disable-account">close your account</a> immediately, or wait until the end of your billing period.</p>

<h2 class="measure">Payment processing</h2><p class="measure">
Blot uses <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> to process subscription payments. This means your payment details never touch Blot’s servers.
