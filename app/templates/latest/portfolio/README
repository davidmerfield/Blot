The _Portfolio_ template is designed for portfolios and posts with code. It features a minimal index page.

We must pay respects to indexhibit.org, who are most directly responsible for the layout of this template. A few other references:

Ideas: Implement the [image panning feature here](https://openletters-online.com/Issue-70-Kenneth-Hasegawa-and-Isa-He-to-3D-TA). Adjustable grid size on index page? This is an obvious reference: indexhibit.org Use tags for sidebar? Recent entries?
