The _Reference_ template is designed for a database of photos and links. It features a grid of small thumbnails for your posts on its index page. It prominently features the tags used on your site.

The layout of the grid itself was taken from [Are.na](https://www.are.na/) with a few tweaks to my taste. The global navigation is designed to get out of the way. It features prominent links to your pages and a list of the tags used on your reference.

You can navigate between the full posts page using the arrows on the left and right. This is heavily designed around images.
