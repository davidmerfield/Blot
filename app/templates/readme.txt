# Spec
- all themes must support a 'landing page' modification nicely
- feed, archive, essays, portfolio, magazine must be optimized for code
- all themes must be colorblind, with goal to add a color customization layer
- Don't think about Blot developers in any way, produce seperate simple templates for them

# Adding a new template

Create a new folder in this directory, name it whatever you want.

# About

I struggled initially with theme design because I was trying to design a themes for all blogs and all material. I think the major things which complicate designs. Some sites have many posts (thousands) and are updated frequently. Some sites have few posts (ten) and are updated infrequently. The quantity of posts has a big effect on the design of the archive page in particular.

Some sites post mostly text, some mostly images, some a mix. This affects the design of the index page. For example, should you show a stream of posts in full on the index page? Or just a list of links to view the full post? Or perhaps a truncated preview of the post?

I would like to produce a few grid based themes for sites which post mostly photos. Some of cargo's grid ideas are worth exploring.

# Fitting the form to the content

Ultimately I must bear in mind a respect for content. I am trying to design a frame for this content to hang on and it is important to avoid the tempation of designing for the frame, instead of the stuff inside (I have no ownership of that so it's hard to be proud of it).

Is cropping thumbnails justifiable? In my mind it seems like this might fall into the category of trying to make the content fit the form, than the other way around. But perhaps that isn't a bad thing? If I want to see a list of articles, perhaps formatting the thumbnail in a particular way is justified.

# Plagiarism 

I've also been struggling with lifting things wholesale from a particular spot. I have been looking at Techcrunch.com far too regularly when making the design for the upcoming magazine theme, for example. This is bad.


Find good source of material, ideally on Blot like this [source for theme content](http://cinebloc.blot.im/)

Improving the templating code

Right now blot fetches a load of information, depending on each route, and uses that to fill a template.

My goal at the moment is to change the code so Blot only fetches information from the database used by the template itself. 

Thankfully mustache exposes 

I will need to remove current metadata about the partial (isPartial) 

When I fetch the partials, I need to check if they themselves have partials, if so, then refetch.

# To create a new theme:

Create a new folder in this directory, name it whatever you want.


I will need a script to write out existing templates in new format


# Revisiting templates

blogs/{{id}}/themes/{{default}}

set blog.template to {{default}} ?

create new Template "Foo bar" in blogs/{{id}}/themes/Foo bar

editing will just save the files directly

can rename the template -> copy folder, set blog.template to new folder, delete old folder.

we could load a users template into memory instead? but what about static files? eh avoid this optimization for now.

we only need to serve-static the non-css and js files in /assets?

on enable local-editing

 theme / theme.json etc...

on enable local editing for multiple

 theme / foo
 theme / bar





Templates should be copy/pastable between blogs

Installation of custom template should be as easy as

'Create folder Template:

Blot themes are derived from a folder of HTML fragments.

If you want to just a tweak a thing or two with an existing template, it's not really neccessary to read all the nonsense below. Just create a clone of the template you'd like to modify, then open it in the template editor. It should be self-explanatory.

Blot uses Mustache to render templates. Please read its documentation. It is important you understand the meaning of a template, a partial and a view.

Blot themes are a collection of **templates** and **partials** which are rendered with a **view** containing variables from your blog.

**Templates** represent the layout for a given page on your blog. **Partials** represent small fragments of a template that repeat across your site like a menu. The **view** is a collection of variables, structured as JSON, which is used to render your template.

Blot generates the view for a template based on a few inputs:

- The tags used in the template
- Local variables specified in your theme's configuation file
- Properties from your blog (e.g. title, profile picture)
- Variables derived from the template's route

## Configuration file

You can use the configuration file to declare template-specific locals and partial templates. Blot's themes use this feature to customize the <title> and description tags of each template.

## Templates

Blot themes inherit a handful of templates and options by default:

- feed.rss (for your blog's RSS feed)
- robots.txt
- sitemap.xml

I assume you probably won't want to modify them, but you can override these templates yourself by creating the corresponding file in your theme's /templates directory.

The template site.xml would be rendered at the url example.com/site.xml. The template foo.html would be rendered at the url example.com/foo. You can adjust the url for a given template. The exceptions are entries.html, entry.html and error.html. Error.html is used for all routes which return nothing. You can override this in your theme's configuration file.

## Partials

If a partial file is called 'footer.html', blot will make it available to views like this:

```
{{> footer}}
```

## Routing

With the exception of entry.html and entries.html, you control the routes
If a view file is called 'archives.html', by default Blot will mount it to /archives You can customize the route used for the view in theme.json.

## Assets

Files in the /assets folder are served. JavaScript and CSS files are minified and rendered like templates. This means you can use variables from your blog or your template inside scripts and stylesheets:

```
body {
  background: {{background_color}};
}
```

Everything else is served as-is. This folder is useful for template-specific images, font-files and that kinds of thing.




stick files inside? indicate selected template with leading *? How does blot know which template to use? Do user templates always exist in Blog folder?

move _assets to .assets or .blot ?
  image cache cannot look up images embedded in doc files
  since they're outside the blot folder

put templates inside this folder

Rewrite Templates
 - Add way to edit a color variable, select an option etc...
 - theme should be a set of options for the color picker...
 - Migrate these currently-global settings to template level:
    date presentation
    hide/show date
    entries per page
 - Store view name should include file extension...
 - Expose errors on design page.







I need to make sure Blot can render 100 pages / second.

Based on current usage, that reflects double the avg. load for 10k blogs.

the render module is currently a shitshow

each template

ENTRIES SHOULD NOT BE VIEWS
  they should not be embeddable -> use albums for similar features...

LOCALS SHOULD NOT CONTAIN LOCALS
  migrate page title and page description to hard coding in template

EACH VIEW SHOULD HAVE A FULL LIST OF PARTIALS & LOCALS


add 'default' template views which templates inherit but can override?

add 'default' partials which templates inherit?

  e.g. {{view.name}} - {{blog.title}}

e.g. feed.rss, sitemap.xml, robots.txt


* / template / default

no template info stored in db

everything stored on disk?

---


template = read(...) ;

mustache.parse(template);

... fetch partials and parse them too
... extract locals from view and all partials
... load locals

mustache.render(template, view);

---

store full list of locals and paths to partials against each template path?
