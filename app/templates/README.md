# About

I struggled initially with theme design because I was trying to design a themes for all blogs and all material. I think the major things which complicate designs. Some sites have many posts (thousands) and are updated frequently. Some sites have few posts (ten) and are updated infrequently. The quantity of posts has a big effect on the design of the archive page in particular.

Some sites post mostly text, some mostly images, some a mix. This affects the design of the index page. For example, should you show a stream of posts in full on the index page? Or just a list of links to view the full post? Or perhaps a truncated preview of the post?

I would like to produce a few grid based themes for sites which post mostly photos. Some of cargo's grid ideas are worth exploring.

# Fitting the form to the content

Ultimately I must bear in mind a respect for content. I am trying to design a frame for this content to hang on and it is important to avoid the tempation of designing for the frame, instead of the stuff inside (I have no ownership of that so it's hard to be proud of it).

Is cropping thumbnails justifiable? In my mind it seems like this might fall into the category of trying to make the content fit the form, than the other way around. But perhaps that isn't a bad thing? If I want to see a list of articles, perhaps formatting the thumbnail in a particular way is justified.

# Plagiarism 

I've also been struggling with lifting things wholesale from a particular spot. I have been looking at Techcrunch.com far too regularly when making the design for the upcoming magazine theme, for example. This is bad.
