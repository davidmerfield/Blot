### Prof. Terry Friedman

{||} ![Profile](_professor.jpg)

{||} **Prof. Terry Friedman** is a Harvard-educated historian and anthropologist specializing in cultural linguistics and cartographic traditions. A tireless explorer of remote societies, Friedman’s most notable expedition was to the Følyar Archipelago in 1979, where he documented the unique "singing cartographers"—a cultural phenomenon where maps are sung rather than drawn, preserving oral histories in melodic form. Friedman’s work, blending meticulous field research with an engaging narrative style, has earned him a reputation as one of the most innovative thinkers in contemporary anthropology. His forthcoming book, *"Sonic Maps: Voices of the Uncharted,"* is eagerly anticipated by scholars and enthusiasts alike.
