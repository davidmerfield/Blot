# Alocasia montana

Alocasia is a genus of broad-leaved rhizomatous or tuberous perennials from the family Araceae. There are 79 species native to tropical and subtropical Asia to Eastern Australia, and widely cultivated elsewhere.

The large cordite or sagittate leaves grow to a length of 20 to 90 cm on long petioles. Their gracious flowers grow at the end of a short stalk, but are not conspicuous; often hidden behind the leaf petioles.

The stem (a corm) is edible, but contains rapid or rawhide crystals of Calcium oxalate along with other irritants (possibly a protease) that can numb and swell the tongue and pharynx resulting in difficult breathing, and sharp throat pain.
