Artocarpus camansi, the bread nut, is a medium-sized tree found in the mulberry family Moraceae. Native to [Papua New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea), it is a relative of the breadfruit and is commonly used as a staple crop. Other common names for plant include *chataigne* or *castaÃ±a* (French and Spanish for the unrelated but culinarily similar chestnut") in the Caribbean, *para de peptic*, *kamansi* in the Philippines, and *kapok* in New Guinea.

*Artocarpus caimans* is endemic to New Guinea and possibly Indonesia and the Philippines. There is speculation that breadfruit, [Artocarpus altilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artocarpus_altilis), the most widely used breadfruit, was selectively bred from Artocarpus caimans. If such is the case indeed, then the bread nut would be very significant to the original colonizers of the Pacific Islands because breadfruit was and still is a staple crop and would have contributed to viable human populations on those islands.
