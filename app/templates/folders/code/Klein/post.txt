In [mathematics](/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the **Klein bottle** <span class="nowrap">[/ˈkl](/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English "Help:IPA for English")</span>[<span title="/aɪ/ long 'i' in 'tide'">aɪn/</span>](/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English "Help:IPA for English") is an example of a [non-orientable](/wiki/Orientability "Orientability") [surface](/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)"); it is a [two-dimensional](/wiki/Two-dimensional "Two-dimensional") [manifold](/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") against which a system for determining a [normal vector](/wiki/Normal_vector "Normal vector") cannot be consistently defined. Informally, it is a one-sided surface which, if traveled upon, could be followed back to the point of origin while flipping the traveler upside down. Other related non-orientable objects include the [Möbius strip](/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip "Möbius strip") and the [real projective plane](/wiki/Real_projective_plane "Real projective plane"). Whereas a Möbius strip is a surface with [boundary](/wiki/Boundary_(topology) "Boundary (topology)"), a Klein bottle has no boundary (for comparison, a [sphere](/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") is an orientable surface with no boundary).

$$
z(\theta, \varphi) = r \sin \theta \cos({\varphi/2})
$$

$$
w(\theta, \varphi) = r \sin \theta \sin({\varphi/2})
$$

The Klein bottle was first described in 1882 by the [German](/wiki/Germany "Germany") mathematician [Felix Klein](/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein"). It may have been originally named the _Kleinsche Fläche_ ("Klein surface") and then misinterpreted as _Kleinsche Flasche_ ("Klein bottle"), which ultimately may have led to the adoption of this term in the German language as well.

The following square is a fundamental polygon of the Klein bottle. The idea is to 'glue' together the corresponding coloured edges so that the arrows match, as in the diagrams below. Note that this is an "abstract" gluing in the sense that trying to realize this in three dimensions results in a self-intersecting Klein bottle.

$$
x(\theta, \varphi) = (R + r \cos \theta) \cos{\varphi}
$$

$$
y(\theta, \varphi) = (R + r \cos \theta) \sin{\varphi}
$$


## Construction

$$
x(u,v) = -\frac{2}{15} \cos u (3 \cos{v}-30 \sin{u}+90 \cos^4{u} \sin{u} \quad 
$$

$$
y(u,v) = -\frac{1}{15} \sin u (3 \cos{v}-3 \cos^2{u} \cos{v}-48 \cos^4{u} \cos{v}+ 48 \cos^6{u}
$$

$$
z(u,v) = \frac{2}{15} (3+5 \cos{u} \sin{u}) \sin{v}
$$
