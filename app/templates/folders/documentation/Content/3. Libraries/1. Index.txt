# Libraries

Our framework supports a variety of libraries to extend functionality and streamline development. Below are the key library categories available:

## Choosing the Right Library

Each library type serves a different purpose. Use the table below to determine which fits your needs:

| Library Type | Purpose | Example Use Case |
