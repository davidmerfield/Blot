# Installation

Welcome to the installation guide for our sample framework. In this section, we will walk you through the steps to get the framework up and running in your project. We support multiple installation methods, including package managers for various platforms, and also provide additional setup options for different environments.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the framework, make sure you have the following:

- A modern package manager (npm, pip, etc.)
- A working internet connection
- Node.js (for JavaScript usage) or Python (for Python usage) installed

To check if you have Node.js and npm installed, run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

To check if you have Python and pip installed, run:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

## Installation Methods

You can install the framework using different methods based on your platform and package manager.

### Installation via npm (JavaScript)

For JavaScript-based projects, you can install the framework via npm:

```bash
npm install my-framework
```

Once installed, import the framework in your project:

```js
import { Framework } from 'my-framework';
```

### Installation via pip (Python)

For Python-based projects, you can install the framework using pip:

```bash
pip install my-framework
```

Once installed, import the framework in your project:

```python
from my_framework import Framework
```

### Installation via Docker

If you prefer to use Docker for containerized environments, you can pull the official image and run it as a container:

```bash
docker pull my-framework
docker run my-framework
```

This will run the framework in an isolated environment. [Learn more about Docker usage](https://example.com/docker).

### Installation via Composer (PHP)

For PHP projects, you can use Composer to install the framework:

```bash
composer require my-framework
```

After installation, you can import the framework in your PHP code:

```php
use MyFramework\Framework;

$framework = new Framework();
$framework->start();
```

## Setting Up Configuration

After installing the framework, you need to configure it according to your environment. Here are the steps for common setups:

### JavaScript Configuration

In JavaScript, you can configure the framework with an API key and environment settings. Here’s an example configuration:

```js
const config = {
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  environment: 'production'
};
const app = new Framework(config);
app.start();
```

### Python Configuration

In Python, the configuration is similar. Here’s an example configuration:

```python
config = {
    "api_key": "your-api-key",
    "environment": "production"
}
app = Framework(config)
app.start()
```

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues during installation, refer to the following common problems and solutions:

- **Problem:** `npm install` fails with an error.  
  **Solution:** Ensure that you have the correct version of Node.js installed. You may need to upgrade npm or delete your `node_modules` and reinstall.

- **Problem:** `pip install` fails with permission issues.  
  **Solution:** Try running `pip` with elevated permissions, or use a virtual environment.

- **Problem:** Docker container fails to start.  
  **Solution:** Ensure Docker is properly installed and running. Verify that you have sufficient system resources to run the container.
