# Getting Started  

This guide will help you install and set up the framework for your project. If you haven't already, check out the [Introduction](/) to get an overview of the framework.  

## Installation  

::: info  
Ensure you have Python 3 or Node.js installed before proceeding.  
:::  

::: steps  

1. Install the framework using your package manager:  

    ```js  
    npm install my-framework  
    ```  
    ```python  
    pip install my-framework  
    ```  

2. Import the framework into your project:  

    ```js  
    import { Framework } from 'my-framework';  
    ```  
    ```python  
    from my_framework import Framework  
    ```  

3. Initialize the framework with your configuration:  

    ```js  
    const config = {  
      apiKey: 'your-api-key',  
      environment: 'production'  
    };  
    const app = new Framework(config);  
    ```  
    ```python  
    config = {  
        "api_key": "your-api-key",  
        "environment": "production"  
    }  
    app = Framework(config)  
    ```  

:::  

## Configuration  

Once installed, you may need to configure the framework to match your needs. Configuration can be set via environment variables or a configuration file.  

**Example configuration file (`config.json`):**  

```json  
{  
  "apiKey": "your-api-key",  
  "environment": "production"  
}  
```  

To load this configuration in your project:  

```js  
import fs from 'fs';  

const config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('config.json', 'utf-8'));  
const app = new Framework(config);  
```  

```python  
import json  

with open('config.json', 'r') as file:  
    config = json.load(file)  

app = Framework(config)  
```
