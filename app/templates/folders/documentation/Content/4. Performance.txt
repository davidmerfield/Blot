Title: Performance

# Performance Overview

Our framework is optimized for speed and efficiency, ensuring minimal resource usage while delivering high performance.

## Benchmarks

We've conducted rigorous testing across different environments. Here are some key performance metrics:

| Metric         | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| Startup Time | ~50ms |
| Memory Usage | ~30MB |
| API Response Time | <10ms |

## Optimizing Performance

To maximize performance, follow these best practices:

::: steps
1. **Use Production Mode**: Ensure the framework is running in production mode.
    ```js
    const app = new Framework({ environment: 'production' });
    ```
    ```python
    app = Framework({ "environment": "production" })
    ```
2. **Enable Caching**: Utilize built-in caching mechanisms to reduce redundant API calls.
3. **Minimize Dependencies**: Only install necessary packages to keep memory usage low.

## Environment Considerations

Performance can vary based on the environment. See our [Environments](/environments) page for OS-specific optimizations.

::: warning
If you experience slow performance, check your system's resource usage and refer to our [Support](/support) page for troubleshooting.
:::

## Load Testing

For enterprise use, we recommend performing load testing using tools like:

- **Apache JMeter**
- **k6**
- **Locust**
