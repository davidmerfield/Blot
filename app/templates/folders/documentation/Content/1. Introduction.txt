# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for our sample project. This guide will walk you through the basics, provide you with detailed [API references](https://example.com/api-reference), and demonstrate example use cases. The project is a lightweight, fast, and reliable framework designed to help developers build applications efficiently. It supports the following features:

- Easy-to-use API
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Modular architecture

## Getting Started

::: steps

1. To begin using the framework, you'll need to install it via your package manager. Here are the installation commands for the most common ones:

    ```js
    npm install my-framework
    ```
    ```python
    pip install my-framework
    ```

2. Once installed, you can import it into your project:

    ```js
    import { Framework } from 'my-framework';
    ```
    ```python
    from my_framework import Framework
    ```

3. Next, initialize the framework with your configuration:

    ```js
    const config = {
      apiKey: 'your-api-key',
      environment: 'production'
    };
    const app = new Framework(config);
    ```
    ```python
    config = {
        "api_key": "your-api-key",
        "environment": "production"
    }
    app = Framework(config)
    ```

## API Reference

The framework exposes several methods to help you interact with your application:

- `app.start()`: Starts the application. [Learn more](https://example.com/docs/start)
- `app.stop()`: Stops the application. [Read more](https://example.com/docs/stop)
- `app.getStatus()`: Returns the current status of the application. [Details here](https://example.com/docs/status)

::: info
We recommend installing this framework as soon as possible

### Example API Usage

```js
const app = new Framework({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  environment: 'development'
});

app.start();
console.log('App status:', app.getStatus());
```
```python
config = {
  "api_key": "your-api-key",
  "environment": "development"
}
app = Framework(config)

app.start()
print('App status:', app.getStatus())
```

## Examples

Here is a simple example of using the framework to create a basic application:

```js
import { Framework } from 'my-framework';

const app = new Framework({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  environment: 'development'
});

app.start();
console.log('App status:', app.getStatus());
```
```python
from my_framework import Framework

app = Framework({
    'apiKey': 'your-api-key',
    'environment': 'development'
})

app.start()
print('App status:', app.getStatus())
```

### Advanced Example with File Upload

To upload a file, you can use the following code in both JavaScript and Python:

```js
import { Framework } from 'my-framework';
import fs from 'fs';

const app = new Framework({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  environment: 'production'
});

const file = fs.readFileSync('path/to/your/file.txt');
app.uploadFile(file);
console.log('File uploaded successfully');
```
```python
from my_framework import Framework

app = Framework({
    'apiKey': 'your-api-key',
    'environment': 'production'
})

with open('path/to/your/file.txt', 'rb') as file:
    app.upload_file(file.read())
print('File uploaded successfully')
```
