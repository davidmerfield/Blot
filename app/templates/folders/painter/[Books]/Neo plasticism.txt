# Neo-Plasticism

*The somewhat peculiar French used in this brochure results from the artist's, of Dutch nationality, rightful demand for the fullest possible approximation of their thought.*

*Editor’s Note*

Although art, on one hand, is the plastic expression of our aesthetic emotion, we cannot conclude that art is merely the "aesthetic expression of our subjective sensations." Logic dictates that art is the plastic expression of our entire being: that it must therefore also be the plastic manifestation of the non-individual, which is its absolute and negating opposition — and, on the other hand, that it must be the direct expression of the universal within us, that is to say, the exact appearance of the universal outside of us.

The universal, understood in this way, is what is and always remains: for us, it is more or less unconscious, in contrast to the more or less conscious — the individual, which repeats and renews itself.

Our entire being is both: the unconscious and the conscious, the immutable and the mutable, arising and changing form through their reciprocal action.

This action contains all the misery and all the happiness of life: misery is caused by continual separation, happiness by perpetual rebirth of the changeable. The immutable is above all misery and all happiness: it is balance.

Through our immutable, we merge with all things; the mutable disrupts our balance, limits us, and separates us from everything other than ourselves. It is from this balance, from the unconscious, from the immutable, that art emerges. It achieves its plastic expression through the conscious. Thus, the manifestation of art is the plastic expression of the unconscious and the conscious. It shows the relationship between the two: it changes, but art remains immutable.

It is possible that within "the totality of our being," the individual or the universal may dominate, or that a balance between the two may be approached. It is this latter possibility that allows us to be universal as individuals, that is, to externalize the unconscious consciously. It is then that we see and hear universally because we have risen above the dominance of the external. Seeing the form of the external appearance, listening to the noises, sounds, and words, they appear to us differently than through our universal vision and hearing. What we truly see or hear is the direct manifestation of the universal, while what we perceive outside of ourselves as form and sound appears weakened and veiled. If we seek plastic expression, we express our universal perception and thereby our universal being as individuals—thus, both in equivalence. To rise above the limiting form and nevertheless employ the delimited form and materialized speech is not a true manifestation of our being; it is not the pure plastic expression. A new plastic expression is inevitable, an equivalent appearance of both the universal and the individual, thus a plastic expression in balanced relation.

All arts strive to achieve the aesthetic plasticity of the existing relationship between the individual and the universal, the subjective and the objective, nature and spirit. Therefore, all arts, without exception, are plastic. Despite this, only Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting are considered plastic arts because we live only in conscious individuality. However, for the unconscious, musical or verbal expression is no less plastic than that of other arts. Pure plastic expression manifests through the unconscious, while it is the plastic expression within the delimited form that the conscious individual creates and represents.

So far, none of the arts have been purely plastic because individual consciousness has dominated; they were all more or less descriptive, indirect, approximating.

The individual, dominant within us and outside of us, "describes." The universal within us does as well, but only if it is not sufficiently conscious in our conscious (individual) to achieve pure appearance.

While the universal within us becomes increasingly conscious, as the indeterminate grows towards the determinate, things outside of us maintain their indeterminate form. Hence the necessity, as the unconscious (the universal within us) approaches the conscious, to constantly transform, to better determine the capricious and indeterminate appearance of the natural phenomenon.

Thus, the new spirit annihilates the delimited form in aesthetic expression and reconstructs an equivalent appearance of the subjective and the objective, the content and the container: a balanced duality of the universal and the individual, and with this "duality-in-plurality," it creates purely aesthetic relation.

It seems that Literature and Music, through description and paraphrase, followed the so-called plastic arts. And vice versa: these plastic arts seem to follow the romantic and symbolic spirit of Literature and Music. As long as the natural form was used as a plastic medium, this tendency towards description could be understood, especially in Sculpture and Painting. This natural form obscures the direct plastic expression of the universal, because the subjective and the objective are not in plastic equivalence. The plastic expressions of both merge together.

The natural plastic appearance presents itself as corporeality. (See De Stijl, year 1, article 4, Dutch organ of Neo-Plasticism.)

This is expressed, in a plastic way, as a sphericity that wants to be flat or as a plane that is forced to be spherical; as a curve tending towards a straight line or a straight line that is forced to be curved.

This plastic expression is therefore not balanced.

Balance was attempted through composition, but through a composition veiled in representation and subject. Thus, it was because impure plastic means were used that Sculpture and Painting arrived at description.

Similarly, the plastic means of the Art of the Verb have become impure (in form) and therefore follow the same path as the so-called plastic arts. There too, the attempt was made to express the content of the whole through paraphrase and not through the verb itself. The verb — assembled in a sentence — weakened as a homogeneous plurality. Symbol was used for expression. However, there are words, several words even, which by their own strength and their mutual relationships can express both principles of being. In all arts, the objective fought the subjective, the universal fought the individual: pure plastic expression fought descriptive expression. Thus, art tended towards balanced plastic.

The imbalance between the individual and the universal creates the tragic and is expressed in tragic plastic. In what is either form or corporeality, nature dominates: this creates the tragic. (De Stijl, year 1 NB, article 8.)

The tragedy of life leads to artistic creation: art, because it is abstract and in opposition to the natural concrete, can precede the gradual disappearance of the tragic. The more the tragic diminishes, the purer art becomes.

The new spirit can only manifest itself within the tragic. It finds only the old-fashioned form, with the new plastic still to be created. Born in the atmosphere of the past, it can only be expressed in the vital reality of the abstract. (De Stijl, year 1 NB, article 9.)
