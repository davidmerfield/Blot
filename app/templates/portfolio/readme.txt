I like the red in some of the photos. Can we compose the homepage to highlight this? I very much like the look and feel of [Sabine Rovers' website](https://sabinerovers.com/Au-Maroc)

Björn Allard (1923-2006) was employed as a photographer at the Swedish National Heritage Board in the 1950s and 1960s. He took part in archaeological surveys and excavations to contribute documentary photographs. Since he held an academic degree in Nordic and comparative archeology, he was certainly well suited for the work. 

An important part of Björn Allard’s tasks was to document at the Board’s culture-historical surveys and archaeological excavations in northern Sweden, due to the regulations of Swedish lakes and rivers at the expansion of hydropower and the construction of new power plants in the 1950s and 1960s. 

About 450 of Björn Allard’s colour slides are digitized for the Board’s photo database, and a choice will be shown on Flickr Commons. Most of Björn Allard’s numerous images in the archives of the Board are in black and white. They are included in the Board’s reports from the surveys at the northern lake regulations.

Five Swedish provinces will be represented in the album. From north to south: Lapland (Lappland), Ångermanland, Jämtland, Dalecarlia (Dalarna), Östergötland and Västergötland. The images will be uploaded in this order, province by province, to make the context clear. 

The images are taken between 1957 and 1963. They show landscapes, cultural environments in the countryside and archaeologists from the Swedish National Heritage Board at field work. Locals in northern Sweden, at work or at leisure, will appear now and then. Lake Satisjaure (Satihaure) with surroundings, shown in the initial images of the album, is today part of Laponia, a world heritage listed by UNESCO.
