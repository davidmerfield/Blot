People are interacting with their live site by adding stuff to their folder. How do you know something will look right without publishing it to your live site? We need some kind of drafting feature or preview feature.

1. First, let Blot know that a file is a draft by putting it inside a folder called 'Drafts'.

2. Blot will let you know how the post will look on your site, without actually publishing it. A new file will appear right next to your post

3. If you make a change to the post, the iframe in your browser will update live, it'll stream changes from Blot's server using SSE.
